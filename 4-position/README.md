# Day 4: Position

Create compelling marketing content to promote your application.

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 4 of the Vibestack workflow! Today focuses on creating compelling marketing content to promote your application. With your functional app ready, it's time to craft the messaging that will attract and engage your target audience.

Today is divided into four key marketing areas, each with a planning and content production phase:
1. **Website Static Marketing Pages**: For direct branded traffic
2. **Website SEO Content Pages**: For attracting search visitors
3. **Email Sequences**: For free users and pro users onboarding
4. **Social Channels**: Strategic selection and content

By the end of today, you'll have a complete marketing package ready to deploy alongside your application launch.

This process typically takes 6-8 hours total. You'll need access to an AI assistant like Claude.ai, a text editor for content creation, and accounts for any marketing platforms you plan to use.
