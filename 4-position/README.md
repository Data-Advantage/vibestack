# Day 4: Position

Create compelling marketing content to promote your application.

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 4 of the Vibestack workflow! Today focuses on creating compelling marketing content to promote your application:
- **Morning**: Develop your marketing website and comprehensive SEO strategy
