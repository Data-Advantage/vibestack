# Day 4: Position

Create compelling marketing content to promote your application.

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 4 of the Vibestack workflow! Today focuses on creating compelling marketing content to promote your application. With your functional app ready, it's time to craft the messaging that will attract and engage your target audience.

Today is divided into several key phases:
- **Morning**: Develop your core marketing messaging and landing page content
- **Afternoon**: Create programmatic SEO content and promotional materials

By the end of today, you'll have a complete marketing package ready to deploy alongside your application launch.

This process typically takes 6-8 hours total. You'll need access to an AI assistant like Claude.ai, a text editor for content creation, and accounts for any marketing platforms you plan to use.
