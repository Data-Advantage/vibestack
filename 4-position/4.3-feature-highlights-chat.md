## 4.3 Feature Highlights

**Goal**: Create engaging descriptions of your key features that emphasize benefits to users.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with an AI chat tool such as [Claude.ai](https://www.claude.ai). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the bracketed text with your own content.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 4.3.1: Feature Benefit Analysis

```
I need to create compelling feature descriptions for my SaaS application that focus on benefits rather than just functionality. I want to ensure that each feature is presented in a way that resonates with users and clearly communicates value.

Please paste your relevant documents below to provide context:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste your PRD from step 1.1 here]
</product-requirements-document>

<value-proposition>
[Paste your value proposition document from step 4.2 here]
</value-proposition>

<feedback-analysis>
[Paste your feedback analysis from step 2.1 here, if available]
</feedback-analysis>

Based on these documents, please help me:

1. Identify the 5-7 most important features of our product
2. For each feature, analyze:
   - The core functionality it provides
   - The primary user problems it solves
   - The key benefits to users
   - How it supports our overall value proposition
   - Any user feedback that confirms its importance

3. Prioritize these features based on:
   - Impact on user experience
   - Uniqueness compared to competitors
   - Alignment with our core value proposition
   - User demand based on feedback

Please provide this analysis in a structured format that will help me develop benefit-focused feature descriptions.
```

### 4.3.2: Feature-to-Benefit Translation

```
Thank you for the feature analysis. Now I'd like to transform each feature description from a functionality-focused description to a benefit-focused one.

For each of the top features you identified, please help me create:

## 1. Feature-Benefit Transformations
For each feature:
- Current feature description (functionality-focused)
- Transformed benefit description (outcome-focused)
- Before/after comparison showing the shift in messaging
- Key verbs and phrases that emphasize user outcomes

## 2. Benefits Hierarchy
For each feature:
- Functional benefits (what it allows users to do)
- Emotional benefits (how it makes users feel)
- Social/identity benefits (how it makes users look to others)
- Financial/ROI benefits (how it creates value or saves money)

## 3. "So What" Analysis
For each feature, apply the "so what" test to dig deeper into benefits:
- Feature: [Feature description]
- So what? [First-level benefit]
- So what? [Second-level benefit]
- So what? [Third-level benefit]
- Ultimate value: [Core value to user]

Please use concrete language and real user scenarios when articulating benefits.
```

### 4.3.3: Feature Messaging Framework

```
Now I'd like to develop a consistent messaging framework for presenting our features across different marketing channels.

Please help me create:

## 1. Feature Description Template
For each feature, develop a consistent structure that includes:
- Feature name/headline (benefit-focused)
- One-line summary that emphasizes primary benefit
- Brief description (2-3 sentences) focusing on user outcomes
- Bullet points highlighting specific advantages
- Supporting evidence or metrics (if available)
- User-focused CTA related to the feature

## 2. Feature Presentation Variations
For each feature, provide variations for:
- Website feature section (50-75 words)
- Email marketing highlight (25-50 words)
- Social media post (15-25 words)
- Sales conversation talking points (3-5 bullet points)

## 3. Visual Storytelling Recommendations
For each feature:
- Visual concept recommendations (screenshot, illustration, animation)
- Key moments or elements to showcase
- Before/after visual storytelling opportunities
- User interaction highlights

Please ensure all messaging maintains a consistent tone and focuses on user benefits rather than technical capabilities.
```

### 4.3.4: Feature Highlight Examples

```
Based on our messaging framework, I'd like to see concrete examples of feature highlights for each of our top features.

For each of the key features we've identified, please create:

## 1. Complete Feature Highlights
Using the template we developed, create a complete feature highlight for each key feature including:
- Benefit-focused headline
- Compelling description
- Supporting bullet points
- Visual concept description
- Call-to-action

## 2. Use Case Scenarios
For each feature:
- 1-2 specific use case scenarios showing the feature in action
- How different user personas might use this feature
- Problem → Solution → Outcome narrative
- Relevant contexts or situations where the feature provides the most value

## 3. Comparative Advantages
Where appropriate:
- How this feature compares to similar features in competing products
- Unique aspects or approaches that differentiate our implementation
- Why our approach delivers better outcomes for users

Please make these examples specific, concrete, and clearly connected to user benefits rather than abstract descriptions.
```

### 4.3.5: Feature Highlight Sequencing

```
Now I need to determine the optimal sequence for presenting our features to potential users.

Please help me develop:

## 1. Feature Presentation Strategy
- Logical sequence for introducing features based on the user journey
- How early vs. advanced features should be presented
- Which features should be highlighted most prominently
- Features that work best as "progressive disclosure" after initial interest

## 2. Feature Grouping Recommendations
- Natural groupings or categories for our features
- How to present feature families or related capabilities
- Primary vs. supporting features hierarchy
- Feature presentation based on user maturity or sophistication

## 3. Channel-Specific Sequencing
- Feature highlight priority for website homepage
- Feature focus for email sequences
- Social media feature highlight strategy
- Sales conversation feature introduction order

## 4. User Segment Considerations
- Feature emphasis for different user segments or personas
- Features that resonate most with specific industries or use cases
- How to adapt feature messaging for different audience types

Please provide a structured approach that ensures our features tell a cohesive story rather than appearing as a disconnected list.
```

### 4.3.6: Feature Objection Handling

```
For each key feature, I need to prepare for potential objections or questions users might have.

Please help me develop:

## 1. Common Objections & Questions
For each feature, identify:
- Potential objections users might have
- Common questions users might ask
- Misconceptions that could arise
- Competitive challenges that might be raised

## 2. Response Frameworks
For each objection/question:
- Clear, concise response that addresses the concern
- Supporting evidence or examples
- Reframing strategies when appropriate
- Transition back to benefits

## 3. Implementation Considerations
- Technical requirements users might ask about
- Integration questions that could arise
- Learning curve considerations
- Support and resources available for each feature

## 4. Alternative Approaches
- When a feature might not be the right fit for certain users
- Alternative approaches we offer
- Use case limitations to be transparent about
- Future roadmap items that might address limitations

Please ensure responses are honest, helpful, and focused on the user's best interest rather than just selling features.
```

### 4.3.7: Feature Highlight Technical Considerations

```
For our marketing team to effectively showcase these features, I need to ensure we have the technical details and visual assets correctly prepared.

Please help me develop:

## 1. Technical Accuracy Requirements
For each feature:
- Key technical details that must be accurately represented
- Capabilities and limitations to be transparent about
- Integration points to highlight
- Technical specifications to include when relevant

## 2. Visual Asset Requirements
- Screenshot requirements (key screens, states, or interactions)
- Animation or video concepts to demonstrate functionality
- Diagram or illustration needs to explain complex features
- Mobile vs. desktop presentation considerations

## 3. Demo and Trial Considerations
- How each feature should be showcased in product demos
- Features to prioritize in free trials or freemium versions
- Guided tour recommendations for new users
- "Aha moment" focal points for each feature

## 4. Technical FAQ Preparation
- Technical questions marketing or sales might receive
- Accurate, non-technical responses to prepare
- Resources for more detailed technical information
- Who internally can address advanced technical questions

This will ensure our marketing presentations are not only compelling but also technically accurate and properly supported.
```

### 4.3.8: Comprehensive Feature Highlights Document

```
Based on all our discussions, please compile a complete, organized feature highlights document that synthesizes all the elements we've developed.

The document should include:

1. Feature Overview
   - List of key features with one-line benefit statements
   - Feature prioritization and grouping strategy
   - Overall narrative flow connecting features to value proposition

2. Individual Feature Highlights
   For each key feature:
   - Benefit-focused headline
   - Compelling description
   - Supporting bullet points
   - Use case examples
   - Visual presentation recommendations
   - Common questions and objections with responses

3. Channel-Specific Feature Presentations
   - Website feature section content
   - Email marketing feature highlights
   - Social media feature content
   - Sales conversation frameworks

4. Implementation Guidelines
   - Technical and visual asset requirements
   - Feature presentation sequence recommendations
   - Audience-specific adaptations

Please format this as a clean, comprehensive markdown document that I can save as `feature-highlights.md` and use to guide all our feature marketing efforts.

This should be a practical document that not only defines our feature messaging, but provides a complete framework for consistently and effectively communicating our features across all channels.
