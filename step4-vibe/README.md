Usage Instructions

1. Submit these prompts in [create-app.md](create-app.md) to v0 in sequence, waiting for each step to complete before moving to the next.
2. Review the code after each prompt to ensure it aligns with your expectations and the specifications in the source files.
3. You may need to make adjustments between prompts based on the actual output.
4. Consider breaking down more complex prompts (like #3 or #6) if v0 struggles with the scope.
5. Add specific requirements or customizations to each prompt as needed for your particular application needs.
6. Each prompt references the appropriate source files that v0 should have access to in the Project Sources data store, which will guide the implementation details.
