# 5.6 Day 1 Learning Capture

This conversation guide will help you convert early feedback into immediate action items and a Week 2 plan.

## Step 1: Feedback Synthesis

[Paste this message to Claude]

I've launched my SaaS product today and received initial feedback from users. I need to synthesize this feedback effectively to identify patterns and priorities. Please help me create:

1. A framework for organizing and categorizing user feedback by:
   - Type (usability, feature request, bug, etc.)
   - Impact on user experience (critical, important, nice-to-have)
   - Frequency (how many users mentioned it)
   - Alignment with core value proposition

2. A template for documenting feedback themes with:
   - Clear description of the issue/request
   - Supporting quotes or observations
   - Potential solutions
   - Estimated impact of addressing it

Please provide a practical process I can use to convert multiple pieces of feedback into actionable insights.

## Step 2: Critical Issues Identification

Based on my initial launch feedback, I need to identify the most critical issues to address immediately. Please help me create:

1. A prioritization framework to identify the top 3 issues that:
   - Block users from experiencing core value
   - Cause the most frustration or confusion
   - Represent significant technical problems
   - Impact conversion or retention

2. A simple template for documenting each critical issue with:
   - Problem statement
   - Impact assessment
   - Potential solutions
   - Required resources to fix
   - Success criteria

Please provide guidance on how to distinguish between truly critical issues and those that can wait for later iterations.

## Step 3: Week 1 Iteration Plan

[Paste this message to Claude]

I need to create a focused action plan for the first week after launch based on user feedback. Please help me create:

1. A structured Week 1 plan that includes:
   - Critical fixes to implement immediately (next 24-48 hours)
   - High-impact improvements for days 3-5
   - Additional user research needed
   - Follow-up communications with users

2. Guidelines for balancing:
   - Bug fixes vs. feature improvements
   - Technical debt vs. new development
   - User requests vs. core roadmap
   - Quick wins vs. fundamental improvements

Please provide a practical, actionable plan that focuses on user retention and core value delivery.

## Step 4: Success Metrics Framework

I need to define clear success metrics for Week 2 based on my launch results. Please help me create:

1. A framework for setting realistic Week 2 goals for:
   - User acquisition
   - User retention
   - Feature usage
   - Conversion (if applicable)
   - User satisfaction

2. A simple dashboard template to track these metrics

3. Guidelines for determining if I should:
   - Continue on current path
   - Make minor adjustments
   - Consider significant pivots

Please provide practical advice on setting ambitious but achievable goals for Week 2 that focus on learning and improvement.

## Step 5: Communication Plan

[Paste this message to Claude]

I need to communicate my Week 2 plans to users who provided feedback during launch. Please help me create:

1. Templates for:
   - Acknowledging specific feedback
   - Sharing what issues I'm addressing immediately
   - Setting expectations for upcoming improvements
   - Requesting additional input on specific questions

2. A communication schedule for Week 2 that:
   - Maintains engagement with early users
   - Builds transparency about my development process
   - Encourages continued feedback
   - Shows appreciation for their input

Please provide practical templates and guidance that will help me maintain relationships with early users while I implement improvements.

## Step 6: Week 2 Planning Document

[Paste this message to Claude]

Now I need to compile everything into a comprehensive Week 2 planning document that will guide my efforts. Please help me create a `week-2-plan.md` document that includes:

1. Executive summary of launch results
2. Key learnings from user feedback
3. Critical issues being addressed
4. Feature development priorities
5. User research plan
6. Success metrics and goals
7. Communication strategy
8. End-of-week evaluation criteria

This document should be practical, actionable, and focused on the most important activities to improve my product based on launch feedback.
