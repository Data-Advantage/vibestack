I need to identify 15-20 potential users who would be ideal candidates to try my newly launched product and provide feedback. My product is:

- Name: [Your product name]

I need to craft personalized outreach messages to potential users for my newly launched product. Please help me create templates for:

1. Close connections (friends, colleagues, supporters)
2. Professional network (industry contacts, LinkedIn connections)
3. Community members (from relevant communities/forums)
4. Cold outreach (if needed)

Each template should:
- Be brief and respectful of their time
- Clearly explain what I built and why I'm reaching out to them specifically
- Request specific, actionable feedback
- Make it easy to say yes 
- Include a clear call-to-action

Product details:

   - Willingness to continue using or paying

2. A simple feedback form/questionnaire (5-7 questions)

## Step 5: Tracking Outreach and Responses

[Paste this message to Claude]

I need a simple system to track my user outreach efforts and organize the feedback I receive. Please help me create:

1. A basic tracking spreadsheet with columns for:
   - Contact information
   - Relationship/context
   - Outreach date and method
   - Response status
   - Feedback received
   - Follow-up actions
   - Notes

2. A process for categorizing and prioritizing feedback
3. A simple way to identify patterns in user responses
4. A follow-up protocol for various response scenarios

Please provide guidance on setting up this tracking system in a way that's lightweight but effective.

## Step 6: Outreach Execution Plan

[Paste this message to Claude]

Now I need a practical execution plan for my direct user outreach. Please help me create a step-by-step process for:

1. Sequencing my outreach (who to contact first, second, etc.)
2. Timing considerations for sending messages
3. How to batch the process efficiently
4. Managing follow-ups without being pushy
5. Transitioning from outreach to ongoing relationship

My goal is to get at least 5-10 active users providing feedback within 48 hours of launch.

Please provide a practical, actionable plan that I can execute immediately after launch.
