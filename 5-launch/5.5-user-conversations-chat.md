## Step 1: Conversation Planning

[Paste this message to Claude]

I need to prepare for direct conversations with my first users to gather in-depth feedback. My product is:

- Name: [Your product name]
- Purpose: [Brief description of what it does]
- Target audience: [Who it's designed for]
- Core value proposition: [What problem it solves]

Please help me prepare for these conversations by creating:

1. A structured conversation guide with:
   - Opening (1-2 minutes)
   - Background questions (2-3 minutes)
   - Product experience discussion (10-15 minutes)
   - Future needs exploration (5 minutes)
   - Closing and next steps (2 minutes)

2. 10-15 specific questions I should ask, focusing on:
   - Their specific problem/need
   - How they currently solve it
   - Their experience using my product
   - What worked well/what didn't
   - What would make them continue using it
   - What would make them pay for it

3. Tips for conducting effective user interviews

## Step 2: Live Product Observation Setup

I'd like to observe users actually using my product during our conversations to get the most valuable feedback. Please help me:

1. Create a short script for asking permission to observe them using the product
2. Set up a practical approach for:
   - Screen sharing (tools recommendation, setup)
   - Asking users to think aloud while using the product
   - Taking effective notes during observation
   - Avoiding leading questions or biasing their experience

3. Develop 3-5 specific tasks I should ask users to complete that would:
   - Demonstrate core functionality
   - Potentially reveal usability issues
   - Show the main value proposition
   - Highlight differentiating features

Product details:
- Key features: [List key features]
- Expected user flow: [Brief description of typical user journey]
- Areas I'm particularly concerned about: [List any specific areas]

I need a system to document and organize the feedback I receive during user conversations. Please help me create:

1. A simple but comprehensive template for documenting each conversation, including:
   - User background information
   - Problem statement and current solutions
   - Observations from product usage
   - Direct quotes and insights
   - Pain points identified
   - Feature requests/suggestions
   - Likelihood of continued use

2. A method for categorizing feedback into:
   - Usability issues
   - Feature requests
   - Value proposition feedback
   - Technical problems
   - Positive reactions

3. A simple prioritization framework for acting on the feedback

Please provide a practical, lightweight system that I can implement immediately after each conversation.

   - Video calls with screen sharing
   - Recording (with permission)
   - Note-taking during calls
   - Scheduling/calendar management

2. A template for:
   - Invitation to the call

I need a strategy for following up with users after our conversations to maintain the relationship and ensure continued feedback. Please help me create:

1. A follow-up sequence including:
   - Immediate thank you message
   - Summary of key takeaways from our conversation
   - Actions I'm taking based on their feedback
   - Request for ongoing feedback
   - Future check-in timeline

2. Templates for each follow-up communication
3. A system for tracking follow-ups and future engagements
4. Ideas for providing value to users who give feedback

My goal is to build relationships with these early users that lead to:
- Continued product usage
- Additional feedback
- Potential testimonials
- Referrals to other users

Please provide a practical, actionable follow-up strategy I can implement.
