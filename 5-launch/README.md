# Day 5: Launch

Deploy your Next.js application to production, get it in front of real users, and gather your first actionable feedback.

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 5 of the Vibestack workflow! Today is when your application goes live:
- **Morning**: Set up minimal analytics and deploy your application

This process typically takes 6-8 hours total. Focus on speed of execution and gathering real user insights.
