### 5.4.1: Identifying Your First Users

```
I need to identify 15-20 potential users who would be ideal candidates to try my newly launched product and provide feedback. My product is:

- Name: [Your product name]
- Purpose: [Brief description of what it does]
- Target audience: [Who it's designed for]
- Core value proposition: [What problem it solves]

Please help me create a systematic approach to identifying my first users, including:

1. Categories of people I should reach out to (connections, community members, etc.)
2. Criteria for selecting the best candidates for early feedback
3. How to prioritize my outreach list
4. Where to find potential users if I don't have existing connections
5. A simple method for organizing my outreach efforts
```

### 5.4.2: Personalized Outreach Messages

```
I need to craft personalized outreach messages to potential users for my newly launched product. Please help me create templates for:

1. Close connections (friends, colleagues, supporters)
2. Professional network (industry contacts, LinkedIn connections)
3. Community members (from relevant communities/forums)
4. Cold outreach (if needed)

Each template should:
- Be brief and respectful of their time
- Clearly explain what I built and why I'm reaching out to them specifically
- Request specific, actionable feedback
- Make it easy to say yes 
- Include a clear call-to-action

Product details:
- Name: [Your product name]
- Purpose: [What it does]
- URL: [Your product URL]
- Specific feedback I'm seeking: [What kind of feedback would be most valuable]
```

### 5.4.3: Offer for Personal Onboarding

```
I want to offer personal onboarding calls to my first 10 users to maximize their experience and gather detailed feedback. Please help me create:

1. A brief template for offering a personal onboarding call
2. A structure for the 20-minute onboarding session, including:
   - Initial welcome and purpose
   - Brief product walkthrough
   - Helping them achieve first value
   - Gathering initial impressions
   - Setting expectations for feedback

3. A simple calendar booking process that makes it easy for users to schedule
4. Post-onboarding follow-up template

- First value moment: [What's the first valuable thing users should experience]
```

### 5.4.4: Conversation Planning

```
I need to prepare for direct conversations with my first users to gather in-depth feedback. Please help me create:

1. A structured conversation guide with:
   - Opening (1-2 minutes)
   - Background questions (2-3 minutes)
   - Product experience discussion (10-15 minutes)
   - Future needs exploration (5 minutes)
   - Closing and next steps (2 minutes)

2. 10-15 specific questions I should ask, focusing on:
   - Their specific problem/need
   - How they currently solve it
   - Their experience using my product
   - What worked well/what didn't
   - What would make them continue using it
   - What would make them pay for it

3. Tips for conducting effective user interviews
```

### 5.4.5: Live Product Observation

```
I'd like to observe users actually using my product during our conversations to get the most valuable feedback. Please help me:

1. Create a short script for asking permission to observe them using the product
2. Set up a practical approach for:
   - Screen sharing (tools recommendation, setup)
   - Asking users to think aloud while using the product
   - Taking effective notes during observation
   - Avoiding leading questions or biasing their experience

3. Develop 3-5 specific tasks I should ask users to complete that would:
   - Demonstrate core functionality
   - Potentially reveal usability issues
   - Show the main value proposition
   - Highlight differentiating features
```

### 5.4.6: Outreach Execution & Follow-up

```
I need a practical execution plan for my direct user outreach and follow-up. Please help me create:

1. A step-by-step process for:
   - Sequencing my outreach (who to contact first, second, etc.)
   - Timing considerations for sending messages
   - How to batch the process efficiently
   - Managing follow-ups without being pushy

2. A follow-up sequence including:
   - Immediate thank you message
   - Summary of key takeaways from our conversation
   - Actions I'm taking based on their feedback
   - Request for ongoing feedback
   - Future check-in timeline

My goal is to get at least 5-10 active users providing feedback within 48 hours of launch and build relationships that lead to continued product usage, additional feedback, testimonials, and referrals.
