### Stakes Section

**Headline:**
## The Cost of Manual Presentation Creation

**Content:**
Every hour spent manually creating presentations is an hour not spent on innovation. For technical teams, this means:

- **Lost Productivity:** Developers waste hours formatting slides instead of building features
- **Inconsistent Quality:** Different team members create vastly different presentations
- **Brand Compliance Issues:** Manual processes lead to off-brand presentations
- **Scaling Limitations:** Can't efficiently increase presentation output without adding headcount

Without automation, your developers will continue wasting hundreds of hours annually on mundane presentation tasks.

## About/Team Content

### Company Story Section

**Headline:**
## Our Story

**Content:**
STORYD.AI was founded by Zack Mazzoncini (CEO) and Michael Grimm (CTO), who have been friends since 2004 when they met at the University of Washington. They have built three successful businesses together: Decisive Data, Ignite Intelligence Solutions, and now Data Advantage, the parent company of STORYD.AI.

With 15 years of experience in building businesses and serving customers, Zack and Michael noticed a consistent problem: technical teams spending countless hours creating business presentations instead of focusing on innovation. This insight led to the development of STORYD.AI v2, transforming from an end-user tool to a developer platform for automated presentation generation.

Our mission is to empower developers and AI systems to programmatically generate enterprise-quality PowerPoint presentations through a developer-first API that leverages our proven business storytelling templates, layout system, and visualization engine.

### Team Profiles

**Zack Mazzoncini, CEO**
With a background in data analytics and business intelligence, Zack brings deep expertise in how businesses communicate through data storytelling. He leads the company vision and go-to-market strategy.

**Michael Grimm, CTO**
Michael's technical expertise spans AI systems, developer platforms, and enterprise software architecture. He oversees the technical direction and ensures STORYD.AI v2 meets the highest standards for developer experience.

### Company Values

1. **Developer Experience First:** We build for developers, by developers, with a focus on elegant APIs and comprehensive documentation.

2. **Quality Without Compromise:** We believe automated presentations should be indistinguishable from professionally designed ones.

3. **Bias for Simplicity:** Complex processes should appear simple to users. We handle complexity so you don't have to.
