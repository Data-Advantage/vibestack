Let me start by refining the marketing content package based on the client's feedback. I'll incorporate the company background information provided:

- Zack Mazzoncini founded this on nights/weekends after he got the idea from his frustrated wife Sarah.
- Brand personality traits: simple, elegant, functional

I'll also finalize each section to provide a comprehensive marketing content package.

Let's organize the sections:

1. Target Audience Profiles (already defined well)
2. Value Proposition Canvas (already defined well)
3. Positioning Statement (already defined well)
4. Unique Selling Proposition (already defined well)
5. StoryBrand Framework (already defined well)
6. Key Marketing Messages (already defined well)
7. Differentiation Strategy (already defined well)
8. Company Background (new section based on feedback)
9. Website Content (new section with homepage, about, pricing)

For the website content, I need to create:
- Homepage content
