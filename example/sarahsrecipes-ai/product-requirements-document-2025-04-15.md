## 4. Implementation Strategy

### 4.1 Basic Features (Day 1 MVP)

These features represent the minimum functionality needed to deliver the core value proposition: AI-powered recipe capture, elegant viewing, and basic organization with a freemium model.

#### Core User Experience
1. **AI Recipe Extraction (URL, Photo, Text)** - The primary differentiator and value driver
   - *Justification*: This is the main user value proposition
   - *Technical consideration*: Implement with single AI provider initially

2. **Distraction-Free Recipe Display** - Clean, elegant viewing experience
   - *Justification*: Directly addresses user pain point with typical recipe sites
   - *Dependencies*: Recipe data structure

3. **Basic Recipe Organization** - Tags and collections
   - *Justification*: Essential for making a useful recipe library
   - *Technical consideration*: Focus on fundamentals before advanced search

4. **Recipe Editor** - Allow users to correct and customize recipes
   - *Justification*: Essential for handling AI extraction errors
   - *Dependencies*: Recipe data structure

#### Essential Infrastructure
5. **User Authentication & Profiles** - Account creation and management
   - *Justification*: Foundation for user identity and data persistence
   - *Technical consideration*: Start with email and one social login

6. **Subscription Management** - Freemium model with 10 free AI imports
   - *Justification*: Core to business model and monetization
   - *Dependencies*: Payment processing

7. **Basic AI Infrastructure** - Task queuing, processing pipeline, and status updates
   - *Justification*: Required for asynchronous AI operations
   - *Technical consideration*: Prioritize reliability over optimization

8. **Essential Admin Tools** - User support, error tracking, and backups
   - *Justification*: Required for operations and support
   - *Technical consideration*: Focus on must-have administrative functions

### 4.2 Advanced Features (Day 3)

These features enhance the core experience and introduce viral growth mechanisms after the fundamental product has been validated.

1. **Potluck Planning Tools** - Event creation, invitation, and recipe assignment
   - *Justification*: Powerful viral growth mechanism but requires core functionality first
   - *Dependencies*: Recipe sharing infrastructure

2. **Enhanced Social Features** - Profiles, sharing, and discovery
   - *Justification*: Expands growth potential but not essential for MVP
   - *Dependencies*: Basic user profiles and recipe storage

3. **Advanced Recipe Tools** - Cooking mode, notes, personalization
   - *Justification*: Enhances user experience but not essential for MVP
   - *Dependencies*: Basic recipe display

4. **AI Optimization** - Provider fallback, performance tuning, token optimization
   - *Justification*: Improves reliability and cost but can evolve after MVP
   - *Dependencies*: Basic AI infrastructure

5. **Enhanced Monitoring** - Usage analytics, system health, audit logging
   - *Justification*: Enables data-driven decisions but can start simple
   - *Dependencies*: Basic administrative tools

### 4.3 Parking Lot (Future Releases)

Features deferred to future releases with rationale and planning considerations.

1. **Shopping List Functionality** (v2)
   - *Justification*: Valuable but separate workflow from core recipe management
   - *Technical consideration*: Design recipe data structure with this future feature in mind

2. **Serving Size Adjustment** (v2)
   - *Justification*: Nice-to-have enhancement but not core to initial value
   - *Technical consideration*: Store recipe quantities in a format that will support future scaling

3. **Advanced SEO Optimization** (v2)
   - *Justification*: More valuable once content volume increases
   - *Technical consideration*: Ensure URLs and basic metadata are SEO-friendly from the start

4. **Content Moderation** (v2)
   - *Justification*: Becomes important only with significant user-generated content
   - *Technical consideration*: Design for flagging capabilities in initial social features

5. **Developer API** (v3/Long-term)
   - *Justification*: Enables ecosystem but unnecessary until product maturity
   - *Technical consideration*: Design internal APIs with potential future exposure in mind

6. **Advanced Data Management** (v3/Long-term)
   - *Justification*: Historical data and retention policies become important at scale
   - *Technical consideration*: Implement basic data structure to support future capabilities
