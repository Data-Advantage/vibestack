- **Guided Refinement**: When users request changes, the system will offer specific refinement options:
  - "Simplify the language in this section"
  - "Add more detail about [specific aspect]"
  - "Restructure to emphasize [alternative priority]"
  - "Try a completely different approach for this section"

- **Alternative Generation**: For critical sections, the system will proactively offer:
  - Multiple variations of key elements (e.g., 3 different value propositions)
  - Side-by-side comparison of alternatives
  - Hybrid options combining elements from different versions

- **Contextual Examples**: When users struggle, the system will automatically provide:
  - Relevant examples from successful projects
  - Templates with guidance on customization
  - "Before and after" demonstrations of refinement

This structured approach to feedback maintains momentum while ensuring quality at each stage of development.
