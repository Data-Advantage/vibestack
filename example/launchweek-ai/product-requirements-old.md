## 1. Executive Summary

LaunchWeek.ai (codename Vibestack) is an AI-guided platform that transforms SaaS ideas into tangible, deployable products within a structured 5-day framework. The initial MVP focuses exclusively on Day 1 of this framework ("CREATE"), enabling non-technical founders to generate comprehensive product requirements, marketing content, and technical implementation guidance through AI assistance.

The platform addresses a critical gap in the market: enabling non-technical innovators to rapidly validate and implement SaaS ideas without extensive development resources or technical expertise. By leveraging advanced AI, LaunchWeek.ai reduces the time, cost, and complexity barriers that prevent many promising ideas from reaching the market.

## 2. Product Vision

### 2.1 Vision Statement
