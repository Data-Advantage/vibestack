- Content Marketing: $20-35 per free user
- Community Referrals: $10-20 per free user
- Google Ads: $45-65 per free user
- LinkedIn Ads: $70-90 per free user
- Podcast Sponsorships: $35-55 per free user

### Expected Conversion Rates
- Visitor to Free Signup: 2-4%
- Free User to Day 1 Completion: 40-50%
- Day 1 to Full Activation (all 5 days): 25-35%
- Free to Paid Conversion: 7-9%
- Annual Plan Adoption: 60% of paid users
- Monthly Churn Rate: 5-7%

### Estimated Economics
- Average Subscription Length: 14 months
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $6.20/month
- Estimated LTV: $86.80 per paid user
- Blended CAC (all channels): $300-400 per paid user
- CAC:LTV Ratio: 3.5:1 to 4.6:1

### Sustainability Recommendations
Given the current pricing model ($7/mo or $70/year) and estimated CAC, the following adjustments are recommended:

1. Focus heavily on organic and referral channels in early stages
2. Test higher price points ($12-15/mo) with expanded features
3. Create additional revenue streams through:
   - Premium templates marketplace (30% commission)
   - Add-on services for successful launches
   - "Done with you" coaching packages

With these adjustments, the sustainable CAC could increase to $150-200 while maintaining healthy unit economics and a break-even timeline of 12-18 months per cohort.

This acquisition strategy prioritizes organic growth and community building in the early stages, followed by strategic paid acquisition as unit economics improve through pricing optimization and additional revenue streams.
