   - Performance metrics collection
   - Debugging aids for API issues

Please provide reusable code patterns for implementing these error handling strategies across different API integrations in my application.
```

### 3.4.4: Webhook Implementation & Event Handling

```
I need to implement or optimize webhook handling for external service events that need to update my application state. This includes payment events from Stripe and [any other webhook sources in your application].

Please help me create:

1. Robust webhook endpoint(s) that:
   - Verify webhook signatures
   - Process events asynchronously
   - Handle duplicate events
   - Respond quickly to the sender
   - Log event receipt

2. Event processing pipeline:
   - Event validation and parsing
   - Database updates based on events
   - Failure handling and retries
   - Event correlation and ordering
   - Event history tracking

3. Testing and debugging tools:
   - Webhook testing utilities
   - Event simulation
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Replay capability for failed events

Please provide the code for implementing these webhook handlers and explain how to properly test them in development and production environments.
```

### 3.4.5: API Rate Limiting & Performance

```
I need to implement strategies to handle API rate limits and optimize the performance of my API integrations.

Please help me create:

1. Rate limit management for:
   - Stripe API calls
   - [Other third-party APIs in your application]
   - Supabase requests
   - Authentication requests

2. Implementation strategies:
   - Request batching and aggregation
   - Caching responses where appropriate
   - Throttling and queueing mechanisms
   - Prioritization of critical requests
   - Backoff strategies for rate limit errors

3. Monitoring and alerting:
