# Day 3: Build

[⬅️ Day 3 Overview](README.md)

## 3.3 Payment Integration

**Goal**: Connect your application to Stripe for seamless subscription management and payment processing.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with your AI coding tool such as [v0.dev](https://www.v0.dev). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the bracketed text with your own content.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 3.3.1: Payment Requirements Analysis

```
I need to implement payment processing and subscription management for my SaaS application using Stripe. I've already built the core application, authentication system, and API integrations. Now I need to add payment capabilities.

Please paste your product requirements document sections related to pricing, subscriptions, and payment below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste relevant parts of your PRD from step 1.1 here, focusing on pricing tiers, billing, and payment requirements]
</product-requirements-document>

Based on these requirements, I need to implement the following payment components:

1. Stripe API integration
2. Subscription plan management
3. Payment processing workflows
4. User subscription status tracking
5. Billing portal access
6. Webhook handling for payment events

Please analyze my requirements and help me create a comprehensive payment implementation plan that:

1. Outlines the Stripe setup process
2. Details the necessary components for subscription management
3. Explains how to handle payment processing securely
4. Describes how to track subscription status in the application
5. Provides guidance on implementing webhooks and events

Please focus on creating a secure, user-friendly payment system that integrates seamlessly with my Supabase backend and existing authentication system.
```

### 3.3.2: Stripe Configuration & Integration

```
Let's start by setting up Stripe and configuring the API integration.

I need guidance on:

1. Creating and configuring my Stripe account:
   - Setting up the developer environment
   - Configuring test mode
   - Creating API keys
   - Setting up webhook endpoints

2. Implementing the Stripe API client in my application:
   - Installing necessary packages
   - Configuring API keys securely
   - Setting up the client connection
   - Handling API errors

3. Defining my subscription products and prices in Stripe:
   - Creating products for each subscription tier
   - Setting up pricing (monthly/yearly options)
   - Configuring features and metadata
   - Managing test data

Please provide step-by-step instructions and code examples for integrating Stripe with my [mention your framework: Next.js, React, etc.] application and Supabase backend. Include details on how to securely store and use API keys in both development and production environments.
```

### 3.3.3: Subscription Management Implementation

```
Now I need to implement the subscription plan management functionality.

Please help me create:

1. A subscription plans component/page that displays:
   - Available subscription tiers
   - Features included in each tier
   - Pricing options (monthly/yearly)
   - Comparison table
   - CTA buttons for each plan

2. Subscription plan data management:
   - Fetching plans from Stripe
   - Storing plan information in the application
   - Displaying current user subscription status
   - Handling plan changes and upgrades/downgrades

3. Free tier implementation (if applicable):
   - Free trial period setup
   - Feature limitations
   - Upgrade prompts
   - Usage tracking

Please provide the code for these components and explain how to:
- Fetch and display subscription plans from Stripe
- Show the appropriate UI based on the user's current subscription
- Handle plan selection and the start of the checkout process
- Store relevant subscription data in Supabase
```

### 3.3.4: Webhook Implementation (Template-Based)

```
To keep my application in sync with Stripe's subscription events, I need to implement webhook handling.

Please help me create:

1. A webhook endpoint that:
   - Verifies Stripe signatures
   - Processes relevant events
   - Updates the database accordingly
   - Handles errors gracefully

2. Event handlers for key subscription events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. Subscription lifecycle management:
   - Handling failed payments
   - Processing subscription cancellations
   - Managing subscription updates
   - Dealing with payment method changes

Please provide the complete code for implementing this webhook system and explain how to test it locally using Stripe's webhook testing tools. Include error handling and security best practices.
```

### 3.3.5: Testing & Troubleshooting

```
Finally, I need to thoroughly test my payment system to ensure it works correctly.

Please help me with:

1. Testing strategies for:
   - Creating test subscriptions
   - Simulating payment successes and failures
   - Testing webhook events
   - Verifying subscription state changes

2. Common issues and how to troubleshoot:
   - Webhook delivery problems
   - API errors and rate limiting
   - Payment failures
   - Subscription sync issues

3. Monitoring and logging:
   - Tracking important payment events
   - Logging webhook processing
   - Setting up alerts for payment failures
   - Monitoring subscription metrics

Please provide a comprehensive testing plan and troubleshooting guide for my Stripe integration, including test credit card numbers and webhook event examples for testing various scenarios.
