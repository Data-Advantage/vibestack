# Day 3: Build

Develop a complete application with all features, connected systems, and responsive design.

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 3 of the VibeStack workflow! Today focuses on transforming your refined prototype into a complete application:
- **Morning**: Implement core functionality and advanced features based on your plans
- **Afternoon**: Connect all systems, optimize performance, and prepare for deployment

By the end of today, you'll have a fully functional application ready for positioning and launch preparation.

This process typically takes 6-8 hours total. You'll continue using AI assistants like Claude.ai, v0.dev, and your Supabase integration from previous days. Today is when your application truly comes to life with all planned features working together.
