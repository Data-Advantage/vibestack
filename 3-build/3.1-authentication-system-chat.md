## 3.1 Authentication System

**Goal**: Implement a robust authentication system with proper user management flows.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with your AI coding tool such as [v0.dev](https://www.v0.dev). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the bracketed text with your own content.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 3.1.1: Authentication Requirements Analysis

```
I need to implement a complete authentication system for my SaaS application. I've already built a prototype and refined it based on user feedback. Now I need to add proper authentication flows.

Please paste your product requirements document below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste your PRD from step 1.1 here]
</product-requirements-document>

Based on these requirements, I need to implement the following authentication components:

1. User authentication with Supabase Auth
2. Email/password signup with email verification
3. Social login options (if applicable to your product)
4. Secure session management
5. Password reset functionality
6. User profile management
7. Role-based access control for different user types

Please analyze my requirements and help me create a comprehensive authentication implementation plan that:

1. Outlines each authentication flow in detail
2. Identifies the UI components needed for each flow
3. Provides guidance on implementing security best practices
4. Explains how to connect the auth system to my existing application
5. Suggests testing strategies for each authentication component

Please focus on creating a secure, user-friendly authentication system that integrates seamlessly with my Supabase backend.
```

### 3.1.2: Signup & Email Verification Implementation

```
Let's start by implementing the user signup and email verification flow. I need to create:

1. A signup form component with:
   - Email field with validation
   - Password field with strength requirements
   - Password confirmation
   - Name/profile fields
   - Terms of service acceptance
   - Submit button with loading state

2. The email verification process:
   - Verification email sending
   - Verification page/route
   - Success/error states
   - Redirect to login after verification

Please provide the code for these components and explain how to:
- Connect them to Supabase Auth
- Handle form validation and errors
- Manage the verification flow
- Implement proper security measures
- Style the components according to my design system

Note: I'm using [mention your framework: Next.js, React, etc.] with Supabase for backend services.
```

### 3.1.3: Login & Session Management

```
Now I need to implement the login functionality and session management for my application.

Please help me create:

1. A login form component with:
   - Email field
   - Password field
   - "Remember me" option
   - Forgot password link
   - Login button with loading state
   - Option to navigate to signup

2. Session management implementation:
   - User session storage
   - Session persistence across page reloads
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Session timeout handling
   - Secure session storage

3. Authentication state management:
   - Global auth context/provider
   - Protected routes/pages
   - Redirect logic for authenticated/unauthenticated users
   - Loading states during auth checks

Please provide the complete code for these components and explain how to integrate them with my existing application structure.
```

### 3.1.4: Password Reset Flow

```
I need to implement a secure password reset flow for my application.

Please help me create:

1. A "Forgot Password" form component with:
   - Email field
   - Submit button
   - Success/error states

2. A password reset page/component with:
   - New password field
   - Password confirmation
   - Submit button
   - Success/error states

3. The complete reset flow implementation:
   - Reset email sending via Supabase
   - Token validation
   - Password update logic
   - Security considerations
   - Redirect to login after successful reset

Please provide the code for these components and explain how to properly secure the reset flow against common vulnerabilities.
```

### 3.1.5: User Profile Management

```
Now I need to implement user profile management functionality that allows users to:
- View their profile information
- Update personal details
- Change their password
- Manage email preferences/notifications
- Delete their account (if applicable)

Please help me create:

1. A profile view/edit component with:
   - Display of current profile information
   - Edit functionality for updatable fields
   - Form validation for profile updates
   - Success/error states

2. A password change component with:
   - Current password verification
   - New password field
   - Password confirmation
   - Submit button with loading state

3. Account management options:
   - Email preferences toggles
   - Account deletion process (with confirmation)
   - Subscription status display (if applicable)

Please provide the code for these components and explain how to connect them to my Supabase backend while ensuring proper security measures.
```

### 3.1.6: Role-Based Access Control

```
I need to implement role-based access control (RBAC) for my application to manage different user types and their permissions.

Based on my product requirements, I need to manage these user roles:
[List your specific user roles, such as:
- Admin
- Paid user
- Free user
- Organization owner
- Team member
- etc.]

For each role, I need to:
1. Define specific permissions/capabilities
2. Restrict access to certain features/routes
3. Show/hide UI elements based on permissions
4. Apply server-side authorization checks

Please help me create:

1. A role management system that:
   - Stores user roles in Supabase
   - Validates permissions on both client and server
   - Handles role assignment and changes

2. Protected components/routes that:
   - Check for required permissions
   - Redirect unauthorized users
   - Gracefully handle permission errors
   - Show appropriate UI for different roles

3. Admin functionality for role management (if applicable)

Please provide the code for implementing this RBAC system and explain how to integrate it with my authentication context.
```

### 3.1.7: Testing & Security Audit

```
To ensure my authentication system is secure and working correctly, I need to implement comprehensive testing and perform a security audit.

Please help me with:

1. Testing strategies for:
   - Unit testing authentication components
   - Integration testing auth flows
   - Edge case handling (network errors, timeouts, etc.)
   - Testing across different browsers/devices

2. Security considerations:
   - Password policies and enforcement
   - Rate limiting and brute force protection
   - Token security and management
   - CSRF protection
   - XSS prevention
   - Secure data storage

3. Common authentication vulnerabilities to check:
   - Account enumeration
   - Password reset vulnerabilities
   - Session fixation
   - Insecure direct object references

Please provide guidance on implementing these tests and security measures, along with any code snippets or configuration needed to secure my authentication system.
```

### 3.1.8: Implementation Review & Optimization

```
Now that we've designed all aspects of the authentication system, let's review the implementation and identify any optimizations or improvements:

1. Review the complete authentication flow from signup to profile management:
   - Are there any gaps or missing components?
   - Is the user experience smooth and intuitive?
   - Are there opportunities to streamline the process?

2. Identify performance optimizations:
   - Reducing unnecessary renders/reflows
   - Optimizing authentication checks
   - Lazy loading auth components when possible

3. Accessibility considerations:
   - Keyboard navigation for all auth forms
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Focus management
   - Clear error messaging

4. Mobile responsiveness:
   - Touch-friendly inputs
   - Viewport adaptations
   - Testing on various devices

Please provide recommendations for these improvements along with any final code adjustments needed to complete the authentication system implementation.
