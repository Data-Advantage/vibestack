# Day 3: Build

[⬅️ Day 3 Overview](README.md)

## 3.2 Payment Integration

**Goal**: Connect your application to Stripe for seamless subscription management and payment processing.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with your AI coding tool such as [v0.dev](https://www.v0.dev). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the bracketed text with your own content.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 3.2.1: Payment Requirements Analysis

```
I need to implement payment processing and subscription management for my SaaS application using Stripe. I've already built the core application and authentication system. Now I need to add payment capabilities.

Please paste your product requirements document sections related to pricing, subscriptions, and payment below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste relevant parts of your PRD from step 1.1 here, focusing on pricing tiers, billing, and payment requirements]
</product-requirements-document>

Based on these requirements, I need to implement the following payment components:

1. Stripe API integration
2. Subscription plan management
3. Payment processing workflows
4. User subscription status tracking
5. Billing portal access
6. Webhook handling for payment events

Please analyze my requirements and help me create a comprehensive payment implementation plan that:

1. Outlines the Stripe setup process
2. Details the necessary components for subscription management
3. Explains how to handle payment processing securely
4. Describes how to track subscription status in the application
5. Provides guidance on implementing webhooks and events

Please focus on creating a secure, user-friendly payment system that integrates seamlessly with my Supabase backend and existing authentication system.
```

### 3.2.2: Stripe Configuration & API Setup

```
Let's start by setting up Stripe and configuring the API integration.

I need guidance on:

1. Creating and configuring my Stripe account:

   - Handling API errors

3. Defining my subscription products and prices in Stripe:
   - Creating products for each subscription tier
   - Setting up pricing (monthly/yearly options)
   - Configuring features and metadata
   - Managing test data

Please provide step-by-step instructions and code examples for integrating Stripe with my [mention your framework: Next.js, React, etc.] application and Supabase backend. Include details on how to securely store and use API keys in both development and production environments.
```

### 3.2.3: Subscription Plan Management

```
Now I need to implement the subscription plan management functionality.

Please help me create:

1. A subscription plans component/page that displays:
   - Available subscription tiers
   - Features included in each tier
   - Pricing options (monthly/yearly)
   - Comparison table
   - CTA buttons for each plan

2. Subscription plan data management:
   - Fetching plans from Stripe
   - Storing plan information in the application
   - Displaying current user subscription status
   - Handling plan changes and upgrades/downgrades

3. Free tier implementation (if applicable):
   - Free trial period setup
   - Feature limitations
   - Upgrade prompts
   - Usage tracking

Please provide the code for these components and explain how to:
- Fetch and display subscription plans from Stripe
- Show the appropriate UI based on the user's current subscription
- Handle plan selection and the start of the checkout process
- Store relevant subscription data in Supabase
```

### 3.2.4: Checkout Process Implementation

```
I need to implement the checkout process to allow users to subscribe to paid plans.

Please help me create:

1. A checkout component/flow with:
   - Stripe Checkout Session integration
   - Selected plan confirmation
   - Payment method collection
   - Success/failure handling
   - Redirect configuration

2. Server-side checkout functionality:
   - Creating Stripe Checkout Sessions
   - Setting the success/cancel URLs
   - Passing appropriate metadata
   - Handling checkout completion

3. Subscription activation process:
   - Verifying successful payment
   - Updating user subscription status
   - Granting access to paid features
   - Sending confirmation emails

Please provide the complete code for implementing this checkout process and explain how to test it using Stripe's test mode. Include both client and server-side components necessary for a secure checkout flow.
```

### 3.2.5: Subscription Status Management

```
I need to implement functionality to track and manage user subscription status within my application.

Please help me create:

1. A subscription status tracking system that:
   - Stores the user's current subscription in Supabase
   - Updates status based on Stripe events
   - Handles subscription lifecycles (active, past_due, canceled, etc.)
   - Manages access to features based on subscription status

2. A user dashboard component/section showing:
   - Current subscription plan
   - Billing period and next payment date
   - Payment history
   - Plan management options (upgrade/downgrade/cancel)

3. Feature access control based on subscription:
   - Checking subscription status before allowing access
   - Displaying appropriate UI for subscription-gated features
   - Handling expired subscriptions
   - Upgrade prompts for feature limitations

Please provide the code for these components and explain how to properly integrate them with my existing authentication system and Supabase database.
```

### 3.2.6: Stripe Customer Portal Integration

```
I want to implement Stripe's Customer Portal to allow users to manage their subscriptions and payment methods directly.

Please help me create:

```

### 3.2.7: Webhook Implementation & Event Handling

Please help me create:

1. A webhook endpoint that:
   - Verifies Stripe signatures
   - Processes relevant events
   - Updates the database accordingly
   - Handles errors gracefully

   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`

   - `invoice.paid`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. Subscription lifecycle management:
   - Handling failed payments
   - Processing subscription cancellations
   - Managing subscription updates
   - Dealing with payment method changes

Please provide the complete code for implementing this webhook system and explain how to test it locally using Stripe's webhook testing tools. Include error handling and security best practices.
```

### 3.2.8: Testing & Troubleshooting
