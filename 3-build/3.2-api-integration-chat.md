[⬅️ Day 3 Overview](README.md)

## 3.2 API & Data Integration

**Goal**: Ensure your application properly connects with all necessary external services and APIs.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with your AI coding tool such as [v0.app](https://v0.app). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the bracketed text with your own content.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 3.2.1: API & Integration Requirements Analysis

```
Now that I've implemented the authentication system for my application, I need to ensure all the necessary API integrations and data connections are properly configured and optimized.

Please paste your product requirements document sections related to external integrations and APIs below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste relevant parts of your PRD from step 1.1 here, focusing on API integrations, data requirements, and external services]
</product-requirements-document>

Based on these requirements, I need to ensure the following connections and integrations are working properly:

1. Convex Function/Query Integration
2. Stripe or Clerk Billing Connection
3. [List any other third-party APIs your application uses]
4. Webhook Handling
5. File Storage (if applicable)
6. External API Connections (if applicable)

Please analyze these integration requirements and help me create a comprehensive plan to:
1. Audit existing connections
2. Identify any missing integrations
3. Optimize current API usage
4. Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
5. Ensure secure credential management

For each integration, I need to ensure:
- Proper authentication
- Efficient data fetching
- Error handling
- Rate limit management
- Data synchronization
```

### 3.2.2: External API Integration Planning

```
I need to plan the integration of my application with key external APIs. Let's define a structured approach for each API integration.

For each of the following external APIs:
[List specific external APIs your application needs to integrate with]

Please help me create:

1. An integration plan that includes:
   - API documentation overview
   - Required credentials and authentication method
   - Key endpoints to implement
   - Data models and transformations needed
   - Testing approach

2. Security considerations:
   - Credential management
   - Rate limiting considerations
   - Data security requirements
   - Compliance requirements (if applicable)

3. Implementation approach:
   - Client-side vs. server-side implementation
   - Direct API calls vs. using SDK
   - Error handling strategy
   - Caching approach

Please provide a detailed integration plan for each API that I can follow to ensure secure and efficient implementation.
```

### 3.2.3: API Playground Implementation

```
I need to create an API playground or testing environment to validate my API integrations before building them into the main application. This will help me verify that connections, authentication, and data handling work correctly.

Please help me implement:

1. A standalone test page or section that:
   - Allows testing connections to each external API
   - Provides a UI for different API operations
   - Displays raw responses and processed results
   - Shows error states and debugging information

2. Connection components for:
   - Setting up and testing authentication
   - Configuring endpoint parameters
   - Handling different request methods (GET, POST, etc.)
   - Visualizing response data

3. Implementation approach:
   - Clean separation from production code
   - Easy reconfiguration for different scenarios
   - Test data generation
   - Realistic error simulation

Please provide the code for implementing this API playground, focusing on both functionality and developer experience. The playground should make it easy to validate all external API integrations before incorporating them into the main application.
```

### 3.2.4: Data Flow & State Management

```
I need to implement a robust data flow and state management system for my API integrations. This should handle fetching, caching, and updating data from various sources while keeping the UI in sync.

Please help me create:

1. A state management strategy that:
   - Manages API data efficiently
   - Handles loading, error, and success states
   - Implements proper caching
   - Provides optimistic updates where appropriate

2. Data fetching patterns for:
   - Initial data loading
   - Pagination and infinite scrolling
   - Real-time updates (if applicable)
   - Refetching and invalidation

3. Application state organization:
   - Logical separation of concerns
   - Proper data normalization
   - Cross-component state sharing
   - Persistent state handling

Please provide the code for implementing this data flow and state management system, with examples for each major API integration in my application.
```

### 3.2.5: Error Handling & Fallbacks

```
I need to implement robust error handling and resilience for all API integrations in my application. This will ensure a better user experience and more stable application behavior.

Please help me create:

1. A comprehensive error handling system for:
   - API request failures
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Rate limiting and throttling
   - Authentication failures
   - Unexpected response formats

2. Resilience patterns implementation:
   - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failing services
   - Fallback strategies for critical features
   - Graceful degradation for non-critical features

3. User-facing error management:
   - Clear error messages for users
   - Appropriate UI for different error types
   - Actionable error recovery options
   - Transparent status updates

4. Monitoring and logging:
   - Error tracking and aggregation
   - API health monitoring
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Debugging aids for API issues

Please provide reusable code patterns for implementing these error handling strategies across different API integrations in my application.
```

### 3.2.6: API Security & Authentication

```
I need to ensure that all API integrations in my application follow security best practices and properly handle authentication.

Please help me implement:

1. Secure credential management:
   - Environment variable usage
   - Secret rotation capabilities
   - Proper credential storage
   - Development vs. production separation

2. Authentication implementation:
   - OAuth flow implementation (if needed)
   - API key management
   - Token refresh mechanisms
   - Session handling

3. Security best practices:
   - HTTPS for all requests
   - Request/response validation
   - Prevention of common vulnerabilities
   - Auditing and monitoring

4. Access control:
   - Permission-based API access
   - User context propagation
   - Role-based limitations
   - Audit logging for sensitive operations

Please provide code examples and configuration patterns for implementing these security measures across my application's API integrations.
```

### 3.2.7: Testing & Documentation

```
To ensure all my API integrations work correctly and continue to function in production, I need to implement comprehensive testing and documentation.

Please help me create:

1. Integration testing suite:
   - End-to-end tests for critical API flows
   - Mocking strategies for third-party APIs
   - Testing for failure scenarios
   - CI/CD integration for continuous validation

2. API documentation:
   - Internal API documentation
   - Integration usage examples
   - Configuration requirements
   - Troubleshooting guides

3. Monitoring implementation:
   - API health checks
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Error rate tracking
   - Latency monitoring
   - Usage analytics

4. Debugging tools:
   - Request/response logging
   - Tracing for API requests
   - Diagnostic endpoints
   - Troubleshooting utilities

Please provide code examples and configuration for implementing these testing and documentation systems, along with guidance on interpreting the results to maintain API health.
