**Timeframe**: 45-60 minutes

### 3.5.1: Dashboard Requirements Analysis

```
I need to implement comprehensive dashboards for my SaaS application. Based on my product requirements, I need to create different types of dashboards for various user roles.

Please paste your product requirements document below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste your PRD from step 1.1 here]
</product-requirements-document>

Based on these requirements, I need to implement the following dashboards:

1. User Dashboard - For regular users to manage their account, view metrics, and access key features
2. Admin Dashboard - For administrators to manage users, content, and system settings
3. Developer Dashboard (if applicable) - For API access, developer tools, and integration management

Please analyze my requirements and help me create a comprehensive dashboard implementation plan that:

1. Outlines the components needed for each dashboard type
2. Identifies the data sources and API endpoints required
3. Suggests an information architecture and navigation structure
4. Provides a strategy for permissions and access control
5. Recommends visualization components and libraries to use

Please focus on creating intuitive, valuable dashboards that provide the right information and controls for each user type while maintaining a consistent design language with the rest of my application.
```

### 3.5.2: User Dashboard Implementation

```
Let's start by implementing the user dashboard for my application.

Based on my product requirements, the user dashboard should include:
[List key elements that should appear in your user dashboard, such as:
- Account information and subscription status

- Recent content or interactions
- Personalized recommendations
- etc.]

Please help me create:

1. A user dashboard layout with:
   - Clear information hierarchy
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Intuitive navigation between sections
   - Visual consistency with my application design

2. Dashboard components such as:
   - Summary cards for key metrics
   - Activity feeds or timelines
   - Settings and configuration panels
   - Feature access points
   - Help and support resources

3. Data integration for:
   - Fetching user profile information
   - Displaying subscription details
   - Loading usage statistics
   - Presenting personalized content

Please provide the complete code for implementing this user dashboard, ensuring it integrates with my existing authentication and data management systems.
```

### 3.5.3: Admin Dashboard Implementation

```
Now I need to implement the admin dashboard for my application, which will allow administrators to manage users, content, and system settings.

Based on my product requirements, the admin dashboard should include:
[List key elements that should appear in your admin dashboard, such as:
- User management interface
- Content moderation tools
- System configuration panels
- Analytics and reporting
- Subscription management
- etc.]

Please help me create:

1. An admin dashboard layout with:
   - Clear separation of different administrative functions
   - Efficient information display for managing many users/items
   - Consistent action patterns for common tasks
   - Permission-based UI elements

2. Admin dashboard components such as:
   - User management table/grid
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Bulk action controls
   - Analytics visualizations
   - System status indicators
   - Configuration forms

3. Data integration for:
   - Loading user data efficiently
   - Managing content and resources
   - Updating system settings
   - Tracking key business metrics

Please provide the complete code for implementing this admin dashboard, ensuring it's properly secured and only accessible to users with administrative privileges.
```

### 3.5.4: Developer Dashboard Implementation (if applicable)

```
[Note: Skip this section if your application doesn't include developer features or API access]

I need to implement a developer dashboard that provides tools and resources for developers integrating with my application's API.

Based on my product requirements, the developer dashboard should include:
[List key elements that should appear in your developer dashboard, such as:
- API key management
- Documentation access
- Usage metrics and quotas
- Webhook configuration
- Test environments
- etc.]

Please help me create:

1. A developer dashboard layout with:
   - Technical information presented clearly
   - Access to API credentials and settings
   - Testing and debugging tools
   - Documentation links and resources

2. Developer dashboard components such as:
   - API key generation and management
   - Usage monitoring and quota displays
   - Webhook configuration interface
   - Request logs and debugging tools
   - Documentation browser

3. Data integration for:
   - Managing API credentials securely
   - Tracking API usage and performance
   - Configuring developer-specific settings
   - Testing API endpoints

Please provide the complete code for implementing this developer dashboard, ensuring it's secure and integrates properly with my API management system.
```

### 3.5.5: Dashboard Feature Integration

```
Now that we've implemented the individual dashboards, I need to integrate them with the rest of my application and ensure all dashboard features function correctly.

Please help me:

1. Connect the dashboards to my application's navigation:
   - Adding dashboard links to the main navigation
   - Creating role-based navigation options
   - Implementing deep links to specific dashboard sections
   - Handling dashboard access permissions

2. Integrate dashboard functionality with core features:
   - Ensuring user actions in dashboards affect the application state
   - Linking dashboard controls to relevant features
   - Implementing real-time updates where appropriate
   - Connecting analytics to user behavior

3. Optimize dashboard performance:
   - Implementing efficient data loading patterns
   - Adding pagination or virtualization for large datasets
   - Caching frequently accessed dashboard data
   - Optimizing dashboard rendering

Please provide the code for these integrations and explain how to ensure the dashboards work seamlessly with the rest of the application.
```

### 3.5.6: Dashboard Testing & Refinement

```
Finally, I need to thoroughly test my dashboards to ensure they function correctly and provide value to users.

Please help me with:

1. Testing strategies for:
   - Verifying dashboard data accuracy
   - Testing interactive elements and controls
   - Checking responsive behavior across devices
   - Validating role-based access controls
   - Ensuring accessibility compliance

2. Common dashboard issues to address:
   - Data loading and error states
   - Empty state handling
   - Performance with large datasets
   - Role-based permission edge cases
   - Navigation clarity and usability

3. Refinement opportunities:
   - Dashboard personalization options
   - Layout improvements for different screen sizes
   - Progressive disclosure of complex information
   - Keyboard navigation and shortcuts
   - Visual hierarchy improvements

Please provide guidance on implementing these tests and refinements to ensure my dashboards are robust, user-friendly, and provide significant value to all user types.
