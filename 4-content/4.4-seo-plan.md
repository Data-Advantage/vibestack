# 4.4.1 SEO Plan

```markdown
You are an expert SaaS Product-Led SEO Planner. Your task is to come up with a basic set of SEO pages to implement and install on a brand new SaaS website. Study the Product Requirements document and Marketing Story and then come up with ideas based on this SEO framework:

# Output

2. Create a list of 5 'facets' related to objects, lists, attributes, or concepts in the SaaS app that could concievably be used in programmatic SEO. Examples: Location, Type, Customer Type, etc.

## Feedback Request

Please review the initial SEO content ideas and facets generated in our previous section. Consider the following:

1. Are the proposed editorial articles aligned with our target audience's search intent?
2. Are there any critical topic areas missing from our list?
3. Do the identified facets accurately represent key attributes that users would search for?
4. Are there additional facets we should consider for our programmatic SEO strategy?

## Value Prioritization

Let's prioritize our content ideas by expected value using these criteria:
- Search volume potential
- Conversion intent
- Competition difficulty
- Brand alignment
- Resource requirements

Based on these factors, please rank our proposed article topics from highest to lowest expected value.

## Facet Optimization Strategy

### Single-Facet Articles
Single-facet articles target variations of one specific attribute. For example, if "Industry" is a facet, we might create articles for:
- Vibestack for Healthcare
- Vibestack for E-commerce
- Vibestack for Education

For each primary facet, we should create comprehensive content covering the most valuable variations.

### Multi-Facet Combinations
By combining two facets, we can create highly specific content that addresses niche audience segments. For example:

| Primary Facet | Secondary Facet | Example Combinations |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Industry | Company Size | Healthcare for Small Business, E-commerce for Enterprise |
| Use Case | Industry | Productivity Tracking in Healthcare, Team Coordination in Construction |
| Location | Company Size | Remote Teams in Enterprise, Distributed Workforce in Startups |

### Recommended Article Volumes

| Combination Type | Target Article Count | Notes |
|------------------|---------------------|-------|
| Single-Facet Articles | 5-10 per primary facet | Focus on highest-value variations first |
| Two-Facet Articles | 15-25 total | Prioritize combinations with clear search intent |
| Editorial Content | 20 | Question-based articles addressing common pain points |

This approach allows us to build a comprehensive SEO foundation while maximizing the efficiency of our content creation resources.

Please provide feedback on this strategy before we finalize our SEO plan.
