# 1.2.1: Core Objects & Initial Schema Analysis

```
Now that you have your product requirements document, let's design a database schema for your SaaS application.

Please paste your completed product requirements document (PRD) from step 1.1 and your database-patterns.md file below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste your PRD here]
</product-requirements-document>

<database-patterns>
[Paste your database-patterns.md file here]
</database-patterns>

Thank you for sharing your product requirements and database patterns. Based on this information, I'll now design the core tables for your SaaS application.

Note that your Supabase instance will already include standard authentication tables. We'll focus on the following table types:
- Core business objects specific to your application
- Profile tables that extend the default auth.users table
- Subscription and billing tables (subscription status, pricing tiers)
- Usage tracking tables if needed
- Stripe integration tables (for webhook data)

Additionally, we'll include notes on:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Helper functions and triggers
- Necessary indexes and views
- Storage requirements

Here's my initial schema analysis based on your requirements and the best practices outlined in your database patterns:
```

# 1.2.2: User Feedback & Final Schema Analysis

```
Here's the initial schema analysis for your database. Please review and provide feedback:

1. Are there any key entities from your product requirements missing?
   [Provide answer]

2. Do the relationships between tables make sense for your application?
   [Provide answer]

3. Are there any specific data requirements I've overlooked?
   [Provide answer]

4. Any other feedback on the proposed schema?
   [Provide answer]

Based on your feedback, I'll update the schema analysis for the final migration script.
```

# 1.2.3: SQL Migration Script Generation

```
Perfect! Based on our discussion and your feedback, I'll now generate the complete SQL migration script that you can run in your Supabase project.

This script will:
1. Create all necessary tables for your application
2. Set up relationships between tables
3. Implement Row Level Security policies
4. Create needed functions and triggers
5. Add indexes and optimizations

Here's the complete SQL migration script:

```sql
-- 000-initial-migration.sql

-- Enable necessary extensions
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";

-- Set up tables
[Table creation SQL will be generated here]

-- Set up relationships & foreign keys
[Foreign key constraints will be generated here]

-- Create RLS policies
[RLS policy SQL will be generated here]

-- Create functions & triggers
[Function and trigger SQL will be generated here]

-- Add indexes for performance
[Index creation SQL will be generated here]
```

## How to use this migration script:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query and paste this entire script
4. Run the script to create your database schema

After running this, your database will be fully set up with proper security policies and optimizations for your SaaS application. Output a single final full intial sql migration file.
