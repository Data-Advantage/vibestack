# Day 1: Idea & Initial App Build

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 1 of the Vibestack workflow! Today focuses on transforming your concept into a well-defined plan with clear requirements. By the end of today, you'll have three foundational documents that will guide your entire project:

- A comprehensive product requirements document that defines your app's features and functionality
- A database schema that structures your application's data
- Marketing content that tells your product's story to potential users

This process typically takes 2-4 hours, depending on the complexity of your idea. You'll need access to an AI assistant like Claude.ai and a basic text editor to save your outputs. No coding experience is requiredâ€”the AI will help you think through technical challenges in accessible terms.

## Process Overview

| Phase | AI Chat Conversation Guide | Output Document |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1.1 - The Product Requirements | [product-requirements-chat](1.1-product-requirements-chat.md) | `product-requirements-document.md` |
| 1.2 - The Database Setup | [database-setup-chat](1.2-database-setup-chat.md) | `000-initial-sql-migration.sql` |
| 1.3 - The Marketing Story | [marketing-story-chat](1.3-marketing-story-chat.md) | `marketing-content.md` |
| 1.4 - The Initial App | [initial-ap-chat](1.4-initial-app-chat.md) | working online app! |

# 1.1 - The Product Requirements

**Goal**: Create a `product-requirements-document.md` file that has a full written description of your product vision, features, and implementation details.

## Process

1. Copy paste each Step in [product-requirements-chat](1.1-product-requirements-chat.md) into a Claude.ai conversation.
2. Follow all directions in [brackets] and replace the bracketed text with your own content.
3. Save the final output into a file named `product-requirements-document.md`

# 1.2 - The Database Setup

**Goal**: Define the data structure (schema) required for the web application using AI assistance, focusing on creating an `000-initial-sql-migration.sql` file that will fully install a custom Postgres database into your Supabase instance.

## Process

1. Copy paste each Step in [database-setup-chat](1.2-database-setup-chat.md) into an AI chat tool like Claude.ai.
2. Follow all directions in [brackets] and replace the bracketed text with your own content to generate the database schema, potentially as SQL or migration files.

# 1.3 - The Marketing Story

**Goal**: Outline the marketing website's structure, content requirements, and potentially generate initial UI components using AI tools.

## Process

1. Copy paste each Step in [marketing-story-chat](1.3-marketing-story-chat.md) into an AI chat tool like Claude.ai for content and structure ideas.
2. Use prompts with UI generation tools like v0.dev for specific components (e.g., landing page sections, feature blocks).
3. Follow all directions in [brackets] and replace the bracketed text with your own content.
