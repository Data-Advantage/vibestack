# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

A Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines what you're building, why you're building it, and who it's for. It serves as a central reference for all stakeholders involved in product development.

## Key Components

- **Product Vision**: High-level statement of what the product aims to achieve
- **Target User Personas**: Detailed descriptions of who will use the product
- **User Journeys**: How users will interact with the product
- **Feature Requirements**: Detailed specifications of functionality
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability considerations
- **Success Metrics**: How you'll measure if the product meets its goals
- **MVP Scope**: The minimum set of features needed for initial release

## Best Practices

- Focus on the "what" and "why," not the "how"
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Include user stories ("As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]")
- Prioritize requirements clearly
- Get input from multiple stakeholders
- Keep the document updated as the product evolves
