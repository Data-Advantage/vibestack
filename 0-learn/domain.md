# Domain Management

Domain names are the addresses users type into their browsers to access your website. Proper domain management is essential for establishing your brand identity online and ensuring reliable access to your SaaS application.

## Key Concepts

- **Domain Registration**: The process of reserving a domain name for a specified period
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: The system that translates domain names to IP addresses
- **Domain Registrar**: Companies that manage the reservation of domain names
- **TLD (Top-Level Domain)**: The last segment of a domain name (.com, .io, .app, etc.)
- **Nameservers**: Servers that store DNS records for your domain

## Best Practices

- **Choose a memorable domain**: Short, easy to spell, and relevant to your brand
- **Secure multiple TLDs**: Register variations to protect your brand
- **Set up auto-renewal**: Prevent accidental expiration
- **Use WHOIS privacy protection**: Shield your personal information
- **Implement proper DNS records**: Ensure correct configuration for email, website, and services

## Common DNS Record Types

- **A Record**: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address
- **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address
- **CNAME Record**: Creates an alias from one domain to another
- **MX Record**: Directs email to the correct mail server
- **TXT Record**: Stores text information, often used for verification
- **SPF Record**: Helps prevent email spoofing
