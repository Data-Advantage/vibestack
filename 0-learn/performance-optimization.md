# Performance Optimization

Performance optimization is the process of improving the speed, responsiveness, and resource efficiency of a web application to enhance user experience and reduce operational costs.

## Key Areas of Optimization

- **Frontend Performance**: Improving loading times and runtime performance
- **Backend Efficiency**: Optimizing server response times and resource usage
- **Database Performance**: Enhancing query speed and data access patterns
- **Network Optimization**: Reducing data transfer size and frequency
- **Resource Loading**: Managing how and when assets are loaded

## Common Optimization Techniques

### Frontend
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization (format, size, compression)
- Minification and bundling of assets
- Tree shaking to remove unused code
- Efficient state management
- Component memoization
- Virtual scrolling for long lists

### Backend
- Query optimization
- Database indexing
- Caching strategies (in-memory, CDN, browser)
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations
- Pagination and data limiting
- Efficient API design

### Network
- HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 implementation
- Resource compression (Gzip, Brotli)
- Content delivery networks (CDNs)
- Resource hints (preload, prefetch, preconnect)
- Service worker caching
