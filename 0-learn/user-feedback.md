# User Feedback Collection & Analysis

User feedback collection is the process of gathering input from users about their experience with your product, while analysis involves organizing and interpreting this feedback to guide improvements.

## Key Concepts

- **User Interviews**: One-on-one conversations with users to gather detailed feedback
- **Usability Testing**: Observing users as they interact with your product
- **Feedback Categorization**: Organizing feedback by type (UI/UX, functionality, performance)
- **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**: Prioritizing fixes based on importance and implementation difficulty
- **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Feedback**: Balancing subjective opinions with measurable data

## Best Practices

- Ask open-ended questions that don't bias responses
- Observe what users do, not just what they say
- Look for patterns across multiple pieces of feedback
- Prioritize issues that prevent users from experiencing core value
- Create actionable improvement plans based on findings
