# Responsive Design

Responsive design is an approach to web development that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it.

## Key Concepts

- **Fluid Grids**: Using relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed units (pixels)
- **Flexible Images**: Ensuring images scale correctly across different devices
- **Media Queries**: CSS technique to apply different styles based on device characteristics
- **Breakpoints**: Specific viewport widths where the layout changes
- **Mobile-First Design**: Starting the design process from the smallest screen size

## Best Practices

- Design for all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop, large screens)
- Test on actual devices, not just browser emulators
- Consider touch vs. mouse interaction patterns
- Optimize performance for mobile devices (reduced assets, efficient code)
- Focus on content hierarchy across all screen sizes
