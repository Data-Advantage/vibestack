# Landing Pages

Landing pages are specialized web pages designed with a single focused objective: to convert visitors into leads or customers. Unlike general website pages, landing pages minimize distractions and direct attention to a specific call to action.

## Key Components

- **Headline**: Clear, benefit-driven statement that grabs attention
- **Subheadline**: Expands on the headline with additional context
- **Hero Section**: Prominent area that communicates your value proposition
- **Benefits/Features**: Clear presentation of what the product or service offers
- **Social Proof**: Testimonials, customer logos, case studies, or statistics
- **Call to Action (CTA)**: Clear button or form driving the desired conversion
- **Visual Elements**: Supporting images, videos, or graphics
- **Minimal Navigation**: Limited or no menu options to reduce distractions
