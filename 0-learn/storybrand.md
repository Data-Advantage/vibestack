# StoryBrand

StoryBrand is a marketing framework created by Donald Miller that helps businesses clarify their message by using the elements of storytelling to connect with customers.

## Key Concepts

The StoryBrand framework consists of 7 elements (SB7 framework):

1. **A Character (The Customer)**: The customer is the hero, not your brand
2. **Has a Problem**: Identify the customer's external, internal, and philosophical problems
3. **Meets a Guide (Your Brand)**: Position your brand as the guide with empathy and authority
4. **Who Gives Them a Plan**: Provide a clear, simple plan to solve their problem
5. **Calls Them to Action**: Give a clear call to action, both direct and transitional
6. **That Helps Them Avoid Failure**: Show what's at stake if they don't act
7. **And Ends in Success**: Paint a vision of how their life will be transformed
