# MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is a development strategy focused on creating a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development.

## Key Concepts

- Core functionality only - no nice-to-have features
- Focuses on solving the primary user problem
- Allows for quick market validation
- Enables rapid iteration based on real user feedback
- Reduces initial development time and cost
