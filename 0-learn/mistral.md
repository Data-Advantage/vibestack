## How It's Used in VibeStack

Throughout the VibeStack workflow, Mistral models can be leveraged as an alternative or complement to other AI tools. During Day 1 (CREATE) and Day 3 (BUILD), these models can assist with code generation, while in Day 4 (POSITION), they can help generate marketing content. The open-source nature of Mistral's models provides flexibility for entrepreneurs who want control over their AI stack or need to self-host models for privacy or compliance reasons.
