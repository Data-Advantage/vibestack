# Product Launch

Product launch is the process of releasing a new product or service to the market. It marks the point where your product moves from development to being available to customers.

## Key Components

- **Launch Strategy**: Overall plan for how, when, and where to launch your product
- **Launch Messaging**: Clear, compelling communication about what your product does and why it matters
- **Launch Channels**: Platforms and methods used to announce and promote your product
- **Launch Timeline**: Sequence and timing of launch activities
- **Launch Metrics**: How you'll measure the success of your launch

## Launch Channels

- **Product Listing Platforms**: Product Hunt, App Store, etc.
- **Social Media**: Strategic announcements on platforms where your audience is active
- **Email Marketing**: Announcements to your subscriber list
- **Content Marketing**: Blog posts, videos, or podcasts announcing the launch
- **Direct Outreach**: Personal invitations to potential users
- **Community Engagement**: Announcements in relevant online communities
- **PR & Media**: Press releases and media coverage

## How It's Used in VibeStack

In Day 5 of the VibeStack workflow, you'll launch your SaaS application by deploying it to production, announcing it on selected platforms, and personally inviting potential users to try it. This focused approach helps you get your product in front of real users quickly, gather valuable feedback, and begin iterating based on actual usage.
