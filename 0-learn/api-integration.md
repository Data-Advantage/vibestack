# API Integration

API integration is the process of connecting different software systems through their application programming interfaces (APIs) to enable data exchange and functionality sharing between them.

## Key Concepts

- **REST APIs**: Representational State Transfer APIs using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **GraphQL**: Query language for APIs that provides more flexibility in data requests
- **Authentication**: Securing API access through API keys, OAuth, or other methods
- **Rate Limiting**: Restricting the number of API calls within a time period
- **Webhooks**: Event-based notifications sent from one service to another

## Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors
- Cache API responses when appropriate to reduce calls
- Implement request batching when possible
- Create abstraction layers around third-party APIs
- Monitor API usage and performance
- Document API integrations for future reference

## Common Integration Types

- **Data Synchronization**: Keeping data consistent across multiple systems
- **Payment Processing**: Connecting with payment gateways like Stripe
- **Authentication**: Integrating with auth providers
- **Email Services**: Sending emails through providers like Resend
- **Analytics**: Tracking user behavior and application performance
- **Storage Services**: Managing file uploads and storage

## How It's Used in VibeStack

In Day 3 of the VibeStack workflow, you'll implement API integrations for your SaaS application, ensuring proper connections with Supabase for database operations, Stripe for payments, and any other third-party services required by your application. This includes implementing secure authentication, efficient data fetching, proper error handling, and webhook processing.
