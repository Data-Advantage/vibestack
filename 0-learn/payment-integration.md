# Payment Integration

Payment integration refers to the process of connecting your application with payment processing services to enable financial transactions such as subscriptions, one-time purchases, or donations.

## Key Concepts

- **Payment Processors**: Services like Stripe, PayPal, or Square that handle payment processing
- **Payment Gateway**: Interface between your application and payment networks
- **Subscription Management**: Recurring billing for SaaS applications
- **Webhooks**: Automated notifications about payment events (successful payments, failed charges, etc.)
- **PCI Compliance**: Security standards for handling credit card information

## Core Components

- **Checkout Flow**: Secure collection of payment information
- **Customer Management**: Storing and managing customer payment profiles
- **Subscription Plans**: Defining and managing different pricing tiers
- **Usage-Based Billing**: Charging based on actual usage of services
- **Payment Analytics**: Tracking revenue, churn, and other financial metrics
