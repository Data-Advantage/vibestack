# Visual Design

Visual design is the use of imagery, color, shapes, typography, and form to enhance usability and improve the user experience. In digital products, it combines aesthetics and functionality to strengthen the brand and enrich the user experience.

## Key Concepts

- **Color Theory**: Understanding how colors work together and evoke emotions
- **Typography**: Selection and arrangement of typefaces for readability and style
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Guiding users' attention to elements in order of importance
- **Whitespace**: Strategic use of empty space to improve readability and focus
- **Consistency**: Creating a unified experience through repeating visual elements

## Visual Design Elements

- **Color System**: Primary, secondary, and accent colors with semantic meaning
- **Typography System**: Font selection, type scale, and text styling guidelines
- **Component Design**: Visual styling of UI components (buttons, cards, forms)
- **Iconography**: Consistent styling and usage of icons throughout the interface
- **Spacing System**: Standardized spacing values for margins and padding
