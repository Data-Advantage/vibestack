# Security

Web application security is the practice of protecting websites and online services from various security threats and vulnerabilities. Effective security measures help prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions.

## Key Security Concepts

- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity through secure methods
- **Authorization**: Controlling access levels to resources based on user roles
- **Data Protection**: Securing sensitive information in transit and at rest
- **Input Validation**: Preventing injection attacks by validating all user inputs
- **Session Management**: Securely handling user sessions to prevent hijacking
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: Controlling which domains can access your resources

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Tricking users into performing unwanted actions
- **SQL Injection**: Attacking database through malicious SQL statements
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)**: Accessing unauthorized resources by manipulating references
- **Broken Authentication**: Weaknesses in auth systems allowing unauthorized access
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Improper security settings exposing vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices

- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization systems
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Keep dependencies and frameworks updated
- Apply the principle of least privilege
- Use HTTP security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
