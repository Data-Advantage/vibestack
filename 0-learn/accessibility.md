# Accessibility

Web accessibility refers to the practice of designing and developing websites and applications that can be used by people with disabilities. It ensures equal access and opportunity for all users, regardless of their abilities or the way they interact with digital content.

## Key Concepts

- **WCAG**: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - international standards for web accessibility
- **Assistive Technology**: Tools like screen readers, voice recognition, or alternative input devices
- **Semantic HTML**: Using appropriate HTML elements that convey meaning, not just presentation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensuring all functionality is available without requiring a mouse
- **Focus Management**: Making it clear which element has focus during keyboard navigation

## Accessibility Principles (POUR)

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users
- **Understandable**: Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents

## Common Accessibility Features

- **Alt text** for images
- **ARIA attributes** to enhance semantics
- **Sufficient color contrast** for text and interface elements
- **Properly labeled form fields**
- **Error identification and suggestions**
- **Resizable text** without loss of functionality
