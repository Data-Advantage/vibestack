# Testing & Quality Assurance

Testing and Quality Assurance (QA) are systematic processes used to evaluate software quality, identify defects, and ensure that applications meet requirements and provide a good user experience.

## Key Testing Types

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or functions in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Testing how multiple components work together
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete user flows from start to finish
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluating application speed and resource usage
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensuring usability for people with disabilities
- **Security Testing**: Identifying vulnerabilities and security issues
- **Cross-Browser/Device Testing**: Verifying functionality across different environments

## QA Best Practices

- Start testing early in the development process
- Write automated tests for critical functionality
- Implement continuous integration to run tests automatically
- Create a test plan with clear test cases and expected results
- Use both manual and automated testing approaches
- Test for edge cases and error conditions
- Document and track bugs in a systematic way

## Common Testing Tools

- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing tool
- **Playwright**: Cross-browser testing automation
- **Lighthouse**: Performance, accessibility, and SEO testing
- **Axe**: Accessibility testing tool
- **Postman**: API testing tool
