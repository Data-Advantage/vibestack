## How It's Used in VibeStack

Claude is a core tool throughout the VibeStack workflow. During Day 1 (CREATE), it helps generate initial application designs and components. In Day 2 (REFINE), it assists with improving designs based on feedback. For Day 3 (BUILD), Claude generates and explains code for implementation.
