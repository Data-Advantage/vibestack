# Value Proposition Canvas

The Value Proposition Canvas is a strategic tool created by Alexander Osterwalder to ensure product-market fit by aligning what your product offers with what your customers need.

## Key Concepts

- **Customer Profile**: Defines the customer segment you're creating value for
  - Jobs: What customers are trying to get done
  - Pains: The negative outcomes, risks, and obstacles they face
  - Gains: The benefits they expect, desire, or would be surprised by

- **Value Map**: Describes how your product or service creates value
  - Products & Services: What you offer
  - Pain Relievers: How you alleviate customer pains
  - Gain Creators: How you create customer gains

- **Fit**: Achieved when your value map addresses the most important elements in the customer profile
