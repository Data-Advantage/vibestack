# Email Marketing

Email marketing is a digital marketing strategy that involves sending targeted messages to a group of recipients via email to nurture leads, build customer relationships, and drive conversions.

## Key Concepts

- **Email Sequences**: Series of automated emails sent based on specific triggers or timeframes
- **List Segmentation**: Dividing email subscribers into smaller groups based on specific criteria
- **Personalization**: Tailoring email content to individual recipients
- **A/B Testing**: Testing different email variations to determine which performs better
- **Email Deliverability**: Ensuring emails reach recipients' inboxes rather than spam folders
- **Metrics**: Open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, and other performance indicators

## Common Email Types

- **Welcome Emails**: Initial emails sent to new subscribers or users
- **Onboarding Sequences**: Series of emails helping new users understand and engage with a product
- **Nurture Campaigns**: Emails designed to build relationships with leads who aren't ready to convert
- **Promotional Emails**: Messages announcing special offers, discounts, or new features
- **Re-engagement Emails**: Communications aimed at inactive subscribers or users
- **Transactional Emails**: Automated messages triggered by specific user actions
