I'd like to develop a comprehensive marketing story for my SaaS product. Please paste your completed product requirements document (PRD) from step 1.1 below:

[Paste your PRD here]
</product-requirements-document>

Thank you for sharing your product requirements. Based on this information, I'll now develop a strategic marketing foundation for your SaaS product.

Let's analyze the following key marketing elements:

## 1. Target Audience Analysis
I'll identify your core customer segments and create detailed profiles including:
- Firmographics (for B2B): company size, industry, revenue
- Demographics: age, gender, location, income level, education
- Psychographics: values, attitudes, interests, lifestyle
- Technographics: technical aptitude, preferred platforms

## 2. Job to be Done Framework
I'll identify:
- Functional jobs your customers are trying to accomplish
- Emotional jobs they want to feel
- Social jobs they want to be perceived doing

## 3. Value Proposition Canvas
Following Strategyzer's model, I'll develop:
- Customer profile (jobs, pains, gains)
- Value map (products/services, pain relievers, gain creators)
- How your solution addresses specific customer needs

## 4. Core Value Proposition Statement
A clear, compelling statement that communicates:
- Who your target customer is
- What problem you solve
- How you're uniquely positioned to deliver value
- Why you're different from alternatives

## 5. StoryBrand Framework
Using Donald Miller's framework, I'll craft a narrative where:
- The customer is the hero
- Your brand is the guide
- You provide a clear plan to help them overcome challenges
- Clear call to action that avoids confusion

Based on your requirements, here's my analysis of these marketing components:
