# Day 1: Create

Turn your idea into a working prototype with core functionality and key components.

## Introduction
Welcome to Day 1 of the Vibestack workflow! Today is divided into two key phases:
- **Morning**: Transform your concept into well-defined plans and requirements
- **Afternoon**: Build your initial app prototype based on those requirements

By the end of today, you'll have both foundational documents AND a working initial version of your application.

This process typically takes 6-8 hours total. You'll need access to an AI assistant like [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai), a basic text editor to save your outputs, and accounts for the recommended tools. No coding experience is required—the AI will help you navigate technical challenges.

## Morning: Planning & Requirements (2-4 hours)

| Phase | Objective | Guide | Output |
|-----|----|-------------|-----------------|
| 1.1 | Product Requirements | [product-requirements](1.1-product-requirements.md) | `product-requirements.md`<br>`user-acquisition.md` |
| 1.2 | Marketing Story | [marketing-story](1.2-marketing-story.md) | `marketing-story.md`<br>`landing-page.md` |
| 1.3 | Landing Page | [landing-page](1.3-landing-page.md) | NextJS codebase deployed on Vercel |

### 1.1 - Product Requirements

**Goal**: Create a `product-requirements.md` file that has a full written description of your product vision, features, and implementation details.

#### Process
1. Copy paste each Step in [product-requirements](1.1-product-requirements.md) into a Claude.ai conversation.
2. Follow all directions in [brackets] and replace the bracketed text with your own content.
3. Save the final PRD output into a file named `product-requirements.md`
4. Also save the user acquisition strategy from Section 1.1.6 as a separate file named `user-acquisition.md`

### 1.2 - Marketing Story

**Goal**: Create compelling marketing narratives and website content that will help users understand and connect with your product.

#### Process
1. Copy paste each Step in [marketing-story](1.2-marketing-story.md) into an AI chat tool like Claude.ai.
2. Follow all directions in [brackets] and replace the bracketed text with your own content.
3. Save the final output as `marketing-story.md`

### 1.3 - Landing Page

**Goal**: Publish a real landing page at a *.vercel.app domain. Take in email address signups of interested users.

#### Process
1. Begin by adding your product requirements and marketing documents to your v0 project.
2. Create a minimal Next.js project in v0 and integrate Clerk (hosted SignUp/SignIn or components) for auth.
3. Optionally add a simple Convex-backed waitlist flow (`/waitlist` page + mutation) if not using Clerk hosted signup.
4. Create a compelling landing page based on your marketing content and apply a cohesive visual style.
5. Deploy to Vercel and thoroughly test your signup flow.
6. Follow the detailed guide in [landing-page](1.3-landing-page.md).

## Afternoon: Building Your Initial App (2-4 hours)

| Phase | Objective | Guide | Output |
|-----|----|-------------|-----------------|
| 1.4 | Backend Setup (Convex + Clerk) | [backend-setup](1.4-backend-setup.md) | Backend package + Convex schema/queries/mutations |
| 1.5 | Working Prototype | [working-prototype](1.5-working-prototype.md) | NextJS codebase deployed on Vercel |

### 1.4 - Backend Setup (Convex + Clerk)

**Goal**: Package inputs for Chef, generate Convex schema/queries/mutations, wire Clerk + Convex, add diagnostics, and prep for v0 handoff.

#### Process
1. Build `backend-package/` from your PRD and feature list
2. Use Chef to generate `convex/schema.ts`, `queries`, `mutations`
3. Wire Clerk + Convex providers and routes
4. Create `/convex` diagnostics page
5. If using v0, copy Convex files and `_generated` into v0

### 1.5 - Working Prototype

**Goal**: Expand your landing page into a working prototype with core functionality using Convex queries/mutations generated by Chef.

#### Process
1. Review your existing progress from sections 1.3 and 1.4
2. Follow each subsection in [working-prototype](1.5-working-prototype.md):
   - 1.5.1: Review Existing Progress
   - 1.5.2: Add Convex files and `_generated` to project (or v0)
   - 1.5.3: App Implementation Planning
   - 1.5.4: Enhance the Homepage
   - 1.5.5: Navigation Structure
   - 1.5.6: Convex Connection
   - 1.5.7-1.5.10: Implement core features and prepare for deployment
3. By day's end, you'll have a functional prototype that uses your database schema and builds upon your landing page!
