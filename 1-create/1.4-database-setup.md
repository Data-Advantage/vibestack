# Day 1: Create

[⬅️ Day 1 Overview](README.md)

## 1.4 Database Setup

**Goal**: Define the data structure (schema) required for the web application, creating an `000-initial-migration.sql` file that will fully install a custom Postgres database into your Supabase instance.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with an AI chat tool such as [Claude.ai](https://www.claude.ai). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the brackets with your own thoughts and ideas.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 1.4.1: Initial Schema Analysis

Have this link open and ready to copy/paste in: [supabase-database-patterns.md](../0-learn/supabase-database-patterns.md)

```
Now that you have your product requirements document, let's design a database schema for your SaaS application.

Please paste your completed product requirements document (PRD) from step 1.1 and your database-patterns.md file below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste your PRD here]
</product-requirements-document>

<database-patterns>
[Paste the content from the database-patterns.md file linked to above.]
</database-patterns>

Based on these documents, let's analyze the core entities needed for your database schema. Please help me identify:

1. Core business objects specific to my application
2. Profile tables that extend the default auth.users table
3. Subscription and billing tables needed for my pricing tiers
4. Usage tracking tables if applicable
5. Any necessary integration tables (like Stripe webhook data)

For each entity, please identify:
- Key attributes/columns
- Primary identifiers
- Basic relationships to other entities
- Access patterns (who needs to read/write this data)

Don't write SQL yet - just create an initial analysis of entities, relationships, and key security/access patterns.
```

### 1.4.2: Core Tables Definition

```
Thank you for the initial analysis. Now let's define the core tables in more detail.

1. Are there any key entities from your product requirements missing?
   [Provide answer]

1. Schema and Table name following Supabase naming conventions
2. Complete column list with:
   - Data types
   - Default values
   - NOT NULL constraints
   - Description of each column's purpose
4. Primary key strategy
5. Timestamps and audit fields needed

For each table, also explain:
- Who can create records
- Who can view records
- Who can update records
- Who can delete records

These access patterns will inform our RLS policies later.
```

### 1.4.3: Relationships & Constraints

```
Now let's define the relationships between our tables.

For each relationship you identified earlier, please specify:

1. The exact foreign key constraints needed
2. Referential integrity actions (ON DELETE, ON UPDATE)
3. Any unique constraints or composite keys
4. Check constraints to enforce data validity

Please structure this as a list of SQL statements we'll need to include in our migration script.
```

### 1.4.4: Security Policies

```
Security is critical for our application. Based on the access patterns we discussed, please define the Row Level Security (RLS) policies needed for each table.

For each table, please specify:
1. Whether we should enable RLS (most tables should have it enabled)
2. FOR SELECT policies - who can view which records
3. FOR INSERT policies - who can create records
4. FOR UPDATE policies - who can modify which records
5. FOR DELETE policies - who can remove which records

Where appropriate, use these common patterns:
- Users can only see their own data
- Organization members can see data within their organization
- Admins can see all data
- Service roles bypass RLS for background processing

Please structure this as a set of CREATE POLICY statements to include in our migration.
```

### 1.4.5: Functions & Triggers

```
Now let's define any helper functions and triggers our schema needs.

Please identify and define:

1. Helper functions for common operations, such as:
   - User permission checks
   - Data validation
   - Complex calculations or aggregations
   
2. Triggers for maintaining data integrity, such as:
   - Updating timestamps
   - Syncing data between tables
   - Enforcing business rules
   - Sending notifications

3. Any stored procedures that would simplify complex operations

Please structure each as a complete SQL function or trigger definition to include in our migration script.
```

### 1.4.6: Optimization & Indexing

```
To ensure our database performs well, let's define indexes and optimization strategies.

Please recommend:

1. Indexes for each table, considering:
   - Common query patterns
   - Foreign keys that need indexing
   - Full-text search requirements
   - Sort operations that would benefit from indexes

2. Any views that would simplify common queries

3. Any materialized views for complex aggregations

4. Partitioning strategies for large tables (if applicable)

Please structure this as a set of SQL statements to include in our migration script.
```

### 1.4.7 (_optional_): Schema Refinement

```
I've reviewed your schema design and have some additional thoughts:

1. [Add any concerns about the proposed schema]
2. [Mention any missing entities or attributes]
3. [Note any performance or scaling considerations]
4. [Suggest any simplifications or optimizations]

Based on this feedback, could you refine the schema design before we generate the final migration script?
```

### 1.4.8: Complete Migration Script

```
Perfect! Based on our discussion and planning, I'd like you to generate the complete SQL migration script for our database.

Please create a comprehensive migration script named '000-initial-migration.sql' that includes:

1. Extension enablement
2. Table creation for all entities
3. Foreign key relationships
4. Security policies
5. Functions and triggers
6. Indexes and optimizations
7. Any seed data needed for reference tables

The script should be ready to run directly in the Supabase SQL Editor with no errors. Please ensure it follows all Supabase best practices and includes appropriate comments.
```

### 1.4.9: Installation Instructions

After generating your complete migration script, here's how to install it:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query and paste this entire script
4. Run the script to create your database schema
5. If you encounter any errors:
   - Copy the complete error message
   - Paste it back to Claude with a request to fix the issue
   - Claude will help diagnose the problem and provide a corrected SQL migration script
   - Run the corrected script in Supabase

After running this successfully, your database will be fully set up with proper security policies and optimizations for your SaaS application. Save the final migration script as `000-initial-migration.sql` in your project repository.
