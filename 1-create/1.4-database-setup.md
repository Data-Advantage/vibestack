# Day 1: Create

[⬅️ Day 1 Overview](README.md)

## 1.4 Database Setup

**Goal**: Define the data structure (schema) required for the web application, creating an `000-initial-migration.sql` file that will fully install a custom Postgres database into your Supabase instance.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with an AI chat tool such as [Claude.ai](https://www.claude.ai). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the brackets with your own thoughts and ideas.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 1.4.1: Initial Schema Analysis

Have this link open and ready to copy/paste in: [supabase-database-patterns.md](../0-learn/supabase-database-patterns.md)

```
Now that you have your product requirements document, let's design a database schema for your SaaS application.

Please paste your completed product requirements document (PRD) from step 1.1 and your database-patterns.md file below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste your PRD here]
</product-requirements-document>

<database-patterns>
[Paste the content from the database-patterns.md file linked to above.]
</database-patterns>

Based on these documents, let's analyze the core entities needed for your database schema. Please help me identify:

1. The schema organization for our application:
   - What custom schemas should we create beyond the reserved Supabase schemas?
   - What types of data should go in each schema?
   - Any enums we should place in the reference schema?

2. Core business objects specific to my application
   - What are the main entities that represent my application's unique value?
   - How do these entities relate to users?

3. Profile and authentication extensions
   - How should we extend the default auth.users table?
   - What additional user-related data do we need to store?

4. Subscription and billing tables for pricing tiers
   - Should we implement the standard Stripe tables outlined in the patterns?
   - What customizations do we need for our specific pricing model?

5. Usage tracking and analytics requirements
   - What usage metrics do we need to track?
   - How will this data be structured for reporting?

For each entity, please identify:
- Key attributes/columns
- Primary identifiers (UUIDs vs serial IDs)
- Basic relationships to other entities
- Access patterns (who needs to read/write this data)

Don't write SQL yet - just create an initial analysis of entities, relationships, and key security/access patterns.
```

### 1.4.2: Core Tables Definition

```
Thank you for the initial analysis. Now let's define the core tables in more detail. For each of the main entities you identified, please provide:

1. Schema and Table name following Supabase naming conventions
2. Complete column list with:
   - Data types
   - Default values
   - NOT NULL constraints
   - Description of each column's purpose
4. Primary key strategy
5. Timestamps and audit fields needed

For each table, also explain:
- Who can create records
- Who can view records
- Who can update records
- Who can delete records

These access patterns will inform our RLS policies later.
```

**Optional**: Advanced feedback questions

```
I'm particularly interested in:

1. Are there any key entities from your product requirements missing?
   [Provide answer]

2. Should we implement soft deletes (using deleted_at) for any tables?
   [Provide answer]

3. What timestamp fields should we include beyond created_at and updated_at?
   [Provide answer]

4. Should we use UUIDs for all primary keys or are there exceptions?
   [Provide answer]
```

### 1.4.3: Relationships & Constraints

```
Now let's define the relationships between our tables.

For each relationship you identified earlier, please specify:

1. The exact foreign key constraints needed
2. Referential integrity actions (ON DELETE, ON UPDATE)
3. Any unique constraints or composite keys
4. Check constraints to enforce data validity

Please structure this as a list of SQL statements we'll need to include in our migration script.
```

**Optional**: Advanced feedback questions

```
Please consider the following questions:

1. How should we handle cascading deletes for user-owned data?
   [Provide answer]

2. Are there any many-to-many relationships requiring junction tables?
   [Provide answer]

3. Do we need any constraints to enforce our business rules?
   [Provide answer]

4. Should any relationships use deferred constraints?
   [Provide answer]

Please structure this as a list of SQL statements we'll need to include in our migration script.
```

### 1.4.4: Security Policies

```
Security is critical for our application. Based on the access patterns we discussed, please define the Row Level Security (RLS) policies needed for each table.

For each table, please specify:
1. Whether we should enable RLS (most tables should have it enabled)
2. FOR SELECT policies - who can view which records
3. FOR INSERT policies - who can create records
4. FOR UPDATE policies - who can modify which records
5. FOR DELETE policies - who can remove which records

Please implement these common policy patterns where appropriate:
- Ownership-based access (users can only see their own data)
- Role-based access (permissions based on user roles)
- Relationship-based access (team members can see team data)

Please structure this as a set of CREATE POLICY statements to include in our migration.
```

**Optional**: Advanced feedback questions

```
Consider the following questions:
1. Do we need any service role bypass mechanisms for background processing?
   [Provide answer]

2. Should some tables have public read access but restricted write access?
   [Provide answer]

3. How should we handle multi-tenant data isolation?
   [Provide answer]

4. Do we need any special policies for admin users?
   [Provide answer]
```

### 1.4.5: Functions & Triggers

```
Now let's define any helper functions and triggers our schema needs.

Please identify and define:

1. Utility functions for common operations:
   - Timestamp management (updating timestamps)
   - User management (creating profiles on signup)
   - Security helper functions (checking permissions)
   - Data validation
   - Complex calculations or aggregations
   
2. Triggers for maintaining data integrity:
   - Updating modified timestamps
   - Syncing data between tables
   - Enforcing business rules
   - Creating related records automatically

3. Functions needed for RLS policies

Please ensure each function follows these security best practices:
- Uses proper schema qualification
- Sets explicit search paths to prevent injection
- Uses appropriate security context (DEFINER vs INVOKER)
- Includes proper error handling

Please structure each as a complete SQL function or trigger definition to include in our migration script.
```

**Optional**: Advanced feedback questions

```
Consider:
1. Do we need any functions to handle user signup or deletion?
   [Provide answer]

2. Should we implement triggers for maintaining audit history?
   [Provide answer]

3. Do we need any specialized billing or subscription functions?
   [Provide answer]
```

### 1.4.6: Optimization & Indexing

```
To ensure our database performs well, let's define indexes and optimization strategies.

Please recommend:

1. Indexes for each table, considering:
   - Foreign keys that need indexing
   - Columns frequently used in WHERE clauses
   - Columns used for sorting (ORDER BY)
   - Full-text search requirements
   - Composite indexes for multi-column queries

2. Views or materialized views for:
   - Common complex queries
   - Reporting and analytics
   - Joining data across schemas

3. Performance optimizations for:
   - Large tables (partitioning if needed)
   - Frequently accessed data
   - Complex join operations

Please structure this as a set of SQL statements to include in our migration script.
```

**Optional**: Advanced feedback questions

```
Consider:
1. Which foreign keys will be frequently queried and need indexes?
   [Provide answer]

2. Do we need any specialized indexes like GIN for JSONB columns?
   [Provide answer]

3. Should we implement any materialized views with refresh schedules?
   [Provide answer]
```

### 1.4.7 (_optional_): Schema Refinement

```
I've reviewed your schema design and have some additional thoughts:

1. [Add any concerns about the proposed schema]
2. [Mention any missing entities or attributes]
3. [Note any performance or scaling considerations]
4. [Suggest any simplifications or optimizations]

Based on this feedback, could you refine the schema design before we generate the final migration script?
```

### 1.4.8: Complete Migration Script

```
Perfect! Based on our discussion and planning, I'd like you to generate the complete SQL migration script for our database.

Please create a comprehensive migration script named '000-initial-migration.sql' that includes:

1. Extension enablement (e.g. pgcrypto)
2. Schema creation
3. Enum types in the reference schema
4. Table creation organized by schema
5. Foreign key relationships
6. Security policies for each table
7. Functions and triggers with proper security
8. Indexes and optimizations
9. Any seed data needed for reference tables

Please ensure the script follows these best practices:
- Creates necessary schemas before using them
- Creates functions before they're referenced by triggers
- Enables RLS on tables with appropriate policies
- Includes proper comments for maintainability
- Follows a logical order of operations

The script should be ready to run directly in the Supabase SQL Editor with no errors.
```

### 1.4.9: Installation Instructions

After generating your complete migration script, here's how to install it:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query and paste this entire script
4. Run the script to create your database schema
5. If you encounter any errors:
   - Copy the complete error message
   - Paste it back to Claude with a request to fix the issue
   - Claude will help diagnose the problem and provide a corrected SQL migration script
   - Run the corrected script in Supabase

After running this successfully, your database will be fully set up with proper security policies and optimizations for your SaaS application. Save the final migration script as `000-initial-migration.sql` in your project repository.
