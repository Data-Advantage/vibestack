### 1.3.1: Setup Supabase Starter

To get started with the Supabase starter template:

1. **Clone the Supabase starter**: 
   - Visit [Supabase Starter on v0.dev](https://v0.dev/community/supabase-starter-VLaYTHTngZT) 
   - Clone the project to your v0 workspace by clicking `Open in v0`
   - This starter includes a complete Next.js project with the following structure:
     - Authentication pages (login and signup) — **you'll repurpose these for your waitlist signup**
     - Supabase client configuration
     - Pre-built form components
     - Middleware for authentication
     - Server-side actions

2. **Create a new v0 Project**:
   - After clicking `Open in v0` there will be a new v0 Chat opened named **Supabase Starter** that is not assigned to a v0 project
   - Create a new v0 Project now by clicking `Create Project` that will house your Supabase Integration

3. **Set up Supabase using the Vercel Integration (Recommended)**:
   - Within v0, use the Vercel Supabase integration option
   - In the `Integrations` tab that opens, choose the `Create` option next to Supabase
   - In the `Create Database` screen choose the Primary Region closest to you and choose `Free Plan` (or Pro Plan) and click `Continue`.
   - Name the database something reasonable like `supabase-myappname`.
   - This provides a database and authentication setup with no manual configuration required
   - The integration automatically sets up all necessary environment variables including:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
     - All Postgres connection variables (`POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_USER`, etc.)
   - This approach eliminates potential configuration errors and saves time

**Understanding the Starter Structure**:
   - The project includes prepared authentication flows:
     - `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login page
     - `app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx` - Signup page (you'll use this for collecting waitlist emails)
     - `components/login-form.tsx` and `components/signup-form.tsx` - Form components
   - Supabase configuration is in the `lib/supabase` directory
   - Server actions for authentication are in `lib/actions.ts`
   - **Note**: You'll repurpose the built-in sign-up form to collect interested users' emails for your waitlist rather than creating a new form from scratch

### 1.3.2: Add Project Documents

Now that you have your v0 project set up, add your product and marketing documents for easy reference:

1. **Access the Source section in project settings**:
   - In your v0 project, click the gear to go to Project Settings
   - Find the "Sources" section, which contains file upload capability

2. **Upload your documents**:
   - Click "Add Sources" which will open a file browser dialog
   - Alternatively, you can drag and drop files directly into the upload area
   - Select the following files from your computer:
     - Your completed PRD from step 1.1 as `product-requirements.md`
     - Your marketing story from step 1.2 as `marketing-story.md`
     - Your landing content from step 1.2 as `landing-content.md`
   - You can select multiple files at once in the file browser

3. **Verify your uploads**:
   - Ensure all three documents appear in your Sources section
   - These documents will now be accessible as references while you build

**Note about database schema**: 
   - In section 1.4, you'll return to the Source section
   - You'll create a file named `000-initial-sql-migration.sql`
   - This will make all your project documents easily accessible as you build your prototype

Having these documents accessible in your project will make it easier to reference key information while building your landing page.

### 1.3.3 Configure Project Styling with TweakCN

Before creating any content, first apply a cohesive visual style to your project using [Tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com):

1. **Navigate to your Supabase Starter Project**:
   - Return to the **Supabase Starter** chat you created earlier in step 1.3.1
   - Ensure you're in the v0 project you created that has Supabase integrated
   - This is important because you need to apply the styling to the correct project

2. **Visit [Tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com)** and click `Try It Now` to browse available styling templates.

3. **Select a template** from the upper left dropdown (first time users will see `Default`) that aligns with your brand identity:
   - Click on your chosen template to view it in detail
   - The template includes theme settings for colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements
   - Consider your target audience and the emotional response you want to evoke
   - Look for templates that offer the right balance of professionalism and creativity
   - Choose a template that works well with your content layout
   - Filter templates specifically for TailwindCSS v3, which is fully compatible with your Next.js project

4. **Copy the template code from TweakCN**:
   - When you are ready with a template choose the `Code` button (in the top right corner)
   - Switch to `TailwindCSS v3` in the first dropdown and set `hsl` in the second dropdown
   - Click the `Copy` button to copy the TailwindCSS configuration to your clipboard. It will need to be pasted inside the prompt in the next section.

5. **Apply the template to your v0 project** using this prompt template in the Supabase Starter chat:
   ```
   Please update the project's styling system before we create any content. Apply this TailwindCSS configuration:

   1. Update tailwind.config.js with these theme settings
   2. Modify app/globals.css to include these CSS variables
   3. Set up the required fonts (Oxanium, Merriweather, Fira Code) using `next/font/google`
   4. Ensure the RootLayout correctly applies all font variables

   Here's the configuration:

   <tailwind>
   [PASTE YOUR COPIED TAILWIND CONFIGURATION FROM TWEAKCN HERE]
   </tailwind>

   Please implement this styling system completely before we move to content creation.
   ```

Allow v0 to implement the style on your project before moving to the content creation step.

6. **Verify the styling implementation**:
   - Check that the fonts, colors, and other design elements are properly configured
   - Review the changes made to globals.css, tailwind.config.js, and layout components
   - Ensure the styling changes won't conflict with the Supabase Starter components

### 1.3.4 Landing Page Creation

Now that your styling is in place, it's time to design and implement your landing page. You've already created the content in previous steps, so you'll now use v0.dev to transform that content into a functional, attractive landing page that collects email addresses for your waitlist.

**Background:** Your marketing materials (`product-requirements.md`, `marketing-story.md`, and `landing-content.md`) are available in your v0 project under Project Settings → Source. You'll use these as the content basis for your landing page.

1. **Navigate to your Supabase Starter Project**:
   - Ensure you're still in the **Supabase Starter** chat from the previous step
   - If you closed the chat, reopen it from your v0 project

2. **Customize the Landing Page with v0.dev**:
   - In the **Supabase Starter** chat, provide this prompt:
   ```
   Now that our styling is in place, design a complete landing page using my existing content in Project Settings → Source:

   1. Use the content from `landing-content.md` as the primary source
   2. Incorporate messaging from `marketing-story.md` 
   3. Ensure design aligns with `product-requirements.md`
   4. Create a responsive page on `/` with:
      - Hero section with compelling headline
      - Key benefits/features with visual hierarchy
      - Call-to-action for waitlist signup using Supabase
      - Success confirmation after signup

   Implement with:
   - Supabase Starter's built-in signup form
   - Our already-applied TweakCN styling system
   - Full responsiveness for all device sizes
   - Text-focused design (no images yet)
   - Modified middleware for unauthenticated access to `/`
   ```

3. **Review the Landing Page Site**:
   - Review the landing page and waitlist built by v0.dev
   - Chat with v0.dev with any issues or modifications
   - Test the signup form to ensure it properly collects email addresses
     - NOTE: You will get an email from Supabase to confirm your email address and the link will **not work** (at this point). This is OK for now until it is fixed in a later step. Just navigate to your login page manually and sign in.
   - Test responsiveness by viewing at different screen sizes
   - Make specific adjustments with follow-up prompts, such as:
     ```
     Please make these specific adjustments to improve the landing page:
     1. Make the hero headline more impactful by [your specific request]
     2. Adjust the spacing in the features section to [your specific request]
     3. Modify the call-to-action button to [your specific request]
     ```

The goal is to have a professional-looking landing page that effectively communicates your value proposition while capturing email addresses for your waitlist using Supabase.

### 1.3.5 Deploy

Deploy your landing page to Vercel directly from v0:

1. **Deploy with v0**:
   - In your v0 project, look for the "Deploy" button in the top navigation bar
   - Click "Deploy" to open the deployment options
   - Note: If you used the Vercel Supabase integration, your environment variables are already configured

2. **Complete the deployment**:
   - Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process
   - v0 will handle the deployment to Vercel automatically
   - Wait for the build and deployment to complete
   - Once finished, you'll see a success message with your *.vercel.app URL
   - Click the URL to open your newly deployed site

4. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Test basic navigation on your landing page
   - Ensure all links and buttons work correctly
   - Check that your page displays properly on different screen sizes

### 1.3.6 Configure Custom Domain and Update Supabase

After your initial deployment, customize your domain and update Supabase settings:

1. **Set a custom Vercel subdomain**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard and select your project
   - Navigate to "Settings" → "Domains"
   - In the "Vercel Domains" section, click "Edit"
   - Enter your preferred subdomain name (e.g., your-product-name.vercel.app)
   - Click "Save" to apply the change
   - Vercel will automatically update your deployment to use this custom subdomain

2. **Update Supabase with your custom domain**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Authentication" → "URL Configuration"
   - Update the "Site URL" field with your new custom domain URL
   - Add the following redirect URLs (replacing with your custom domain):
     ```
     https://your-product-name.vercel.app/auth/callback
     https://your-product-name.vercel.app/auth/reset-password
     ```
   - Click "Save" to apply these changes

3. **Redeploy your site if needed**:
   - If you've made any code changes to accommodate the new domain:
     - Return to v0 and click "Deploy" again
     - Verify that all settings are correct
     - Complete the redeployment process
   - If no code changes were made, Vercel automatically updates your deployment with the new domain

4. **Verify domain configuration**:
   - Visit your new custom domain URL
   - Ensure the site loads correctly
   - Test authentication flows work properly with the new domain
   - Check that all links on your site use the new domain

This custom domain configuration ensures a more professional appearance for your landing page and proper functioning of authentication flows, particularly for email confirmation links that need to redirect users back to your application.

### 1.3.7 Test the Waitlist

Thoroughly test the waitlist signup functionality on your deployed site:

1. **Test various signup scenarios**:
   - Valid email addresses (personal and work domains)
   - Invalid email formats (should show proper validation errors)
   - Empty form submission (should prevent submission)
   - Duplicate signups (should handle gracefully)
   - Remember: You're using Supabase's built-in authentication system to collect waitlist emails

2. **Verify email confirmation process**:
   - Sign up with a test email address
   - Check your inbox for the confirmation email
   - Test the confirmation link to ensure it works correctly
   - Verify that the confirmation success page displays properly

3. **Check database records**:
   - Log in to your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to Table Editor → auth.users
   - Verify that test users appear in the database
   - Check that email verification status updates correctly

4. **Test the user experience flow**:
   - Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
   - Verify that success messages appear appropriately
   - Check that the UI provides clear next steps after signup
   - Test the mobile experience of the entire flow

5. **Fix any issues identified**:
   - Address any errors or unexpected behavior
   - Make UI/UX adjustments as needed
   - Redeploy if necessary after making changes
