### 1.3.1: Setup Minimal Project with Clerk

Start with a brand new v0 project, immediately install the Project Instructions, then initialize a simple Hello World, and finally wire Clerk for authentication.

1. **Create a new v0 Project**
   - In v0, click `Create Project`
   - Do not start the chat yet. First install the Project Instructions (next step)

2. **Install Project Instructions in v0 (Knowledge → Project Instructions)**
   - In your v0 project, click the gear icon to open `Project Settings`
   - Navigate to `Knowledge` → `Project Instructions`
   - Open and copy all contents from: [v0 Project Instructions](../0-learn/v0-project-instructions.md)
   - Paste into the `Project Instructions` field and click `Save`
   - This guides v0 on stack, routes, and auth/billing defaults; you can refine later

3. **Initialize Hello World in v0 chat (First message)**
   - Paste the prompt below into your v0 chat to scaffold a clean Hello World using App Router. In the next step, you will paste Clerk’s auth setup instructions from the Clerk dashboard.

   ```
   Use the Project Instructions in Project Settings → Knowledge → Project Instructions (v0-project-instructions.md) as the source of truth. Create a minimal Next.js 15 App Router starter UI (TypeScript, Tailwind) under /app only (no /src): a header and footer per the instructions, a simple Home page with a hero and primary CTA, and stub pages for the routes listed there (/pricing, /dashboard, /terms, /privacy). No auth yet. Return a short summary of changes and the file tree. After this is done in the next prompt we will add in instructions for how to enable Clerk authentication.
   ```

4. **Create a new Clerk project (Clerk dashboard)**
   - Open `https://dashboard.clerk.com` and click `Create application`
   - Choose `Next.js` and select `App Router`
   - After creation, Clerk will show your `Publishable key` and `Secret key`
   - On the Overview page, click the "Copy prompt" button — you'll paste this into v0 in the next step

5. **Paste the Clerk Overview prompt into v0 (Second message)**
   - Return to your v0 project chat and paste the Clerk Overview prompt as-is. This will instruct v0 to set up Clerk auth routes, UI, provider, and middleware according to Clerk’s guidance.

   ```
   [PASTE THE CLERK OVERVIEW PROMPT YOU COPIED FROM THE CLERK DASHBOARD INTO V0]
   ```

6. **Provide Clerk environment variables to v0 (when prompted)**
   - In Clerk → your application → Overview, copy your `Publishable key` and `Secret key`.
   - In v0, when asked for environment variables, provide:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
     CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
     ```
   - Save and let v0 continue applying the Clerk setup. Your CTAs should point to `/sign-up` and a verified account is considered on the waitlist.

### 1.3.2: Add Project Documents

Now that you have your v0 project set up, add your product and marketing documents for easy reference:

1. **Access the Source section in project settings**:
   - In your v0 project, click the gear to go to Project Settings
   - Find the "Sources" section, which contains file upload capability

2. **Upload your documents**:
   - Click "Add Sources" which will open a file browser dialog
   - Alternatively, you can drag and drop files directly into the upload area
   - Select the following files from your computer:
     - Your completed PRD from step 1.1 as `product-requirements.md`
     - Your marketing story from step 1.2 as `marketing-story.md`
     - Your landing content from step 1.2 as `landing-page.md`
   - You can select multiple files at once in the file browser

3. **Verify your uploads**:
   - Ensure all three documents appear in your Sources section
   - These documents will now be accessible as references while you build

**Note about backend**: 
   - In section 1.4, you'll generate Convex `schema.ts`, `queries`, and `mutations` with Chef
   - You can copy those into v0 and set Convex + Clerk env vars to connect to your real backend

Having these documents accessible in your project will make it easier to reference key information while building your landing page.

### 1.3.3: Configure Project Instructions

Project Instructions provide essential context to guide the v0 coding agents when working on your project. These instructions help the agents understand your tech stack, architectural patterns, and where to find key information.

1. **Access the Instructions section in project settings**:
   - In your v0 project, click the gear to go to Project Settings
   - Scroll down to find the "Instructions" section
   - This section contains a text field where you can provide context about your project

2. **Copy and paste these instructions**:
   - Copy the text block below and paste it into the Instructions field:
   ```
   This project uses App Router, Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The codebase integrates with Supabase for authentication and database functionality.

   Key resources are available in Project Sources:
   - product-requirements.md: Contains product specifications and feature requirements
   - marketing-story.md: Contains marketing messaging and positioning
   - landing-page.md: Contains landing page content structure and copy

   The project follows a component-based architecture with server components where possible and client components where interactivity is needed. Authentication is handled through Supabase Auth with email verification.
   ```

3. **Customize the instructions if needed**:
   - You can modify the instructions to better match your specific project goals
   - Add additional architectural patterns or coding standards if relevant
   - Ensure the instructions are clear and concise for the v0 agents to follow

4. **Save your instructions**:
   - Click "Save" at the bottom of the page to apply your changes
   - These instructions will now be available to guide the v0 agents as they help you build your project

These Project Instructions serve as a crucial reference for v0 agents when interpreting your requests and generating code that aligns with your project's architecture and requirements.

### 1.3.4 Configure Project Styling with TweakCN

Before creating any content, first apply a cohesive visual style to your project using [Tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com):

1. **Navigate to your Supabase Starter Project**:
   - Return to the **Supabase Starter** chat you created earlier in step 1.3.1
   - Ensure you're in the v0 project you created that has Supabase integrated
   - This is important because you need to apply the styling to the correct project

2. **Visit [Tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com)** and click `Try It Now` to browse available styling templates.

3. **Select a template** from the upper left dropdown (first time users will see `Default`) that aligns with your brand identity:
   - Click on your chosen template to view it in detail
   - The template includes theme settings for colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements
   - Consider your target audience and the emotional response you want to evoke
   - Look for templates that offer the right balance of professionalism and creativity
   - Choose a template that works well with your content layout
   - Filter templates specifically for TailwindCSS v3, which is fully compatible with your Next.js project

4. **Copy the template code from TweakCN**:
   - When you are ready with a template choose the `Code` button (in the top right corner)
   - Switch to `TailwindCSS v3` in the first dropdown and set `hsl` in the second dropdown
   - Click the `Copy` button to copy the TailwindCSS configuration to your clipboard. It will need to be pasted inside the prompt in the next section.

5. **Apply the template to your v0 project** using this prompt template in the Supabase Starter chat:
   ```
   Please implement the following TweakCN theme in my Next.js project. I need you to:
   
   1. COMPLETELY REPLACE the CSS variables in app/globals.css with the new theme values
   2. UPDATE tailwind.config.ts to support ALL theme elements including:
      - Standard colors (background, foreground, primary, etc.)
      - Sidebar colors
      - Chart colors
      - Shadow values
      - Border radius settings
   
   3. SET UP the required fonts DIRECTLY in app/layout.tsx:
      - Define each font from next/font/google with appropriate weights
      - Use proper variable naming like '--font-sans', '--font-serif', '--font-mono'
      - Apply these variables in the body className
   
   4. FIND AND REPLACE all hardcoded color values across the codebase with theme variables:
      - Replace specific hex codes like bg-[#161616] with bg-background
      - Replace component colors like button backgrounds with theme variables
   
   Here is the TweakCN theme to implement:
   
   <theme>
   {{tweakcn_theme}}
   </theme>
   
   After implementing these changes, please show me the updated files and highlight the key changes made. Please ensure all font references are defined directly in layout.tsx, not in a separate fonts file.
   ```

Allow v0 to implement the style on your project before moving to the content creation step.

6. **Verify the styling implementation**:
   - Check that the fonts, colors, and other design elements are properly configured
   - Review the changes made to globals.css, tailwind.config.js, and layout components
   - Ensure the styling changes won't conflict with the Supabase Starter components

### 1.3.5 Main Landing Page

The main landing page is your primary marketing asset that communicates your value proposition and drives visitors to sign up for your waitlist.

In the **Supabase Starter** chat, provide this prompt:

```
Please design a clean, modern landing page for my product using my existing content in Project Settings → Sources:

1. Use the content from `landing-page.md` as the primary source of copy
2. Incorporate messaging from `marketing-story.md` to strengthen the narrative
3. Ensure design aligns with `product-requirements.md`

Create a responsive page at the root route `/` following this structure:
- Above the fold section with bold headline, compelling subheadline, primary CTA button, and secondary CTA button
- Stakes section (what's at risk if they don't solve their problem)
- Value proposition (3-4 core benefits with compelling descriptions)
- Guide section (establish authority)
- Simple 3-step plan showing how easy it is to work with you
- Success vs. Failure section (showing contrast of outcomes)
- Repeated CTA section
- FAQ section (5-8 common questions with answers)

Visual design recommendations:
- Vary the background colors between sections for visual separation
- Use the primary theme color for the repeated CTA section background
- Include Lucide React icons for visual interest
- Create strong visual hierarchy with color, size and spacing
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds
- Do not include a large footer - we'll create that separately
- All CTA buttons should link to the waitlist signup page

Technical implementation:
- Create individual components for each section in the `/components/landing/` directory
  - Example: `/components/landing/Hero.tsx`, `/components/landing/Features.tsx`, etc.
  - Follow a consistent naming convention for all landing page components
- Import and use all these components in `/app/page.tsx`
- Implement with our already-applied TweakCN styling system
- Ensure full responsiveness for all device sizes
- Use text-focused design (no images yet)
- Modify middleware for unauthenticated access to `/`
- Replace any "Login" CTAs in the header/navigation with "Join Waitlist" buttons that direct to the signup page
- Add conditional logic in the header/navigation to:
  - Show "Join Waitlist" button for unauthenticated users
  - Show a confirmation message like "✓ On Waitlist" or "Waitlist Confirmed" for authenticated users
  - Style the confirmation message using success colors from the theme
  - Optionally include a small dropdown menu for authenticated users with options like "View Status" and "Logout"

REMEMBER: It is very important to use the exact content already provided in Project Settings → Sources → `landing-page.md` as the primary source of copy
```

### 1.3.6: Signup Flow (Clerk hosted or component)

Choose one:
- Clerk hosted pages for signup/login (fastest)
- Minimal in-app pages using `<SignIn/>` and `<SignUp/>`

In your v0 chat, provide this prompt (adjust for your choice):

```
Now I need a clean, focused waitlist signup page that matches the example I showed you. Please:

1. Implement a signup page at `/sign-up` using Clerk components or hosted UI
2. Use Clerk email verification; do not create a custom users table
3. DO NOT implement an email form directly on the home page
4. Use the content from Project Settings → Sources → `landing-page.md` as the primary source of copy

Create a signup page with:
- Distinctive background color that matches our brand
- Bold headline
- Supportive subheadline
- Brief explanation text
- Simplified form with:
  - Email field with clear placeholder text "you@example.com"
  - Password field (if enabling email/password)
  - High-contrast CTA button
- Privacy reassurance message at the bottom
- Clean, generous spacing and proper visual hierarchy

Technical implementation:
- Use Clerk components (hosted or embedded)
- Retain proper email validation
- Ensure full responsiveness for mobile devices
- Implement with our already-applied TweakCN styling system
- Add specific error handling for duplicate signup attempts:
  - Catch Supabase "User already registered" errors by examining the error.message from the auth.signUp response
  - Display a friendly message like "You're already on the waitlist!" in a visually distinct container at the top of the form
  - Add a "Sign in instead" link that redirects to the login page
  - Ensure error messages are styled consistently with the design system (consider using destructive/error colors with reduced opacity for the background)
  - Preserve the user's input when showing the error message rather than clearing the form

Additionally, create a "Check Your Email" verification page that appears after form submission:
- Create this page at `/auth/verify-email/page.tsx`
- Use the same styling as the signup page for consistency
- Display a message: "Please check your email"
- Show the user's email address that was submitted
- Include text explaining they need to verify their email to complete the process
- Add the following action buttons with appropriate spacing:
  - "Request New Link" button that triggers a resend verification email function
  - "Sign In" button that redirects to the login page
  - "Back to Home" link that returns to the landing page
- Implement the resend verification functionality using Clerk’s hosted flow or components
- Add visual feedback when a new verification email is requested (success message)
- Modify the auth flow to redirect to this page after form submission
```

### 1.3.7 Success Confirmation Page

After a user verifies their email (by clicking the link in the confirmation email) or successfully logs in through the login page, they should see a success confirmation page that provides positive feedback.

In the **Supabase Starter** chat, provide this prompt:

```
Please create a success confirmation page that displays after a user either:
1. Clicks the verification link in their confirmation email, OR
2. Successfully logs in through the login page
3. Use the content from Project Settings → Sources → `landing-page.md` as the primary source of copy

This page should:
1. Create a new page at `/auth/success/page.tsx`
2. Use the same background color/styling as the signup page for visual consistency
3. Include a checkmark icon (from Lucide React) centered above the text
4. Display a headline, as well as their email address
5. Show a success message, as well as a Next Steps section
6. Maintain the same clean, focused design aesthetic as the signup page

Technical implementation:
- Modify the authentication flow to redirect to this page in both scenarios:
  - After successful email verification (redirect from auth callback)
  - After successful login
- Add a client-side redirect in the login success handler to point to /auth/success
- Ensure the page is responsive and maintains visual consistency with the signup page
- Implement with our already-applied TweakCN styling system

Also modify the login page at `/auth/login/page.tsx` to match the styling of the signup page for a consistent experience.
```

### 1.3.8 Footer, Terms and Privacy Pages

Every professional website needs a simple footer and legal pages. These establish credibility and meet basic legal requirements.

In the **Supabase Starter** chat, provide this prompt:

```
Please create a simple footer and basic legal pages for our landing page:

1. Create or effect a minimal footer component that only includes:
   - App name and copyright notice
   - Links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages
   - No large navigation or additional content

2. Create a (legal) route group to organize our legal pages:
   - Create folder structure at `/app/(legal)` to house legal pages
   - This route group won't affect URL paths but improves code organization

3. Create basic Terms of Service page at `/app/(legal)/terms/page.tsx` (accessible at `/terms`) with:
   - Standard terms of service content appropriate for a waitlist/early access product
   - Clear section headings and organized structure
   - Last updated date

4. Create basic Privacy Policy page at `/app/(legal)/privacy/page.tsx` (accessible at `/privacy`) with:
   - Standard privacy policy content appropriate for a waitlist/early access product
   - Explanation of how email addresses will be used
   - Cookie policy
   - Clear section headings and organized structure
   - Last updated date

Technical implementation:
- Use our TweakCN styling system for consistent design
- Create a Footer component to be included on all pages
- Ensure all pages are responsive
- Link the footer on all existing pages (landing page, signup, success)
- Use the content from Project Settings → Sources → `landing-page.md` as the primary outline
```

### 1.3.9 Review and Integration

After creating all the components separately, review the entire flow and make any necessary adjustments for consistency.

1. **Review the complete user journey**:
   - Landing page to waitlist signup
   - Signup form to success confirmation
   - Navigation through terms and privacy pages
   - Ensure consistent styling across all pages

2. **Make any necessary adjustments**:
   - Test all links to ensure they work correctly
   - Check for visual consistency across all pages
   - Ensure responsive design works on all pages
   - Fix any issues with the authentication flow

The goal is to have a cohesive, professional-looking website that effectively communicates your value proposition and captures waitlist signups with a smooth, intuitive user experience.

### 1.3.10 Deploy

Deploy your landing page to Vercel directly from v0:

1. **Deploy with v0**:
   - In your v0 project, look for the "Deploy" button in the top navigation bar
   - Click "Deploy" to open the deployment options
   - Note: If you used the Vercel Supabase integration, your environment variables are already configured

2. **Complete the deployment**:
   - Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process
   - v0 will handle the deployment to Vercel automatically
   - Wait for the build and deployment to complete
   - Once finished, you'll see a success message with your *.vercel.app URL
   - Click the URL to open your newly deployed site

4. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Test basic navigation on your landing page
   - Ensure all links and buttons work correctly
   - Check that your page displays properly on different screen sizes

### 1.3.11 Configure Custom Domain and Update Supabase

After your initial deployment, customize your domain and update Supabase settings:

1. **Set a custom Vercel subdomain**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard and select your project
   - Navigate to "Settings" → "Domains"
   - In the "Vercel Domains" section, click "Edit"
   - Enter your preferred subdomain name (e.g., your-product-name.vercel.app)
   - Click "Save" to apply the change
   - Vercel will automatically update your deployment to use this custom subdomain

2. **Update Supabase with your custom domain**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Authentication" → "URL Configuration"
   - Update the "Site URL" field with your new custom domain URL
   - Add the following redirect URLs (replacing with your custom domain):
     ```
     https://your-product-name.vercel.app/auth/callback
     https://your-product-name.vercel.app/auth/reset-password
     ```
   - Click "Save" to apply these changes

3. **Redeploy your site if needed**:
   - If you've made any code changes to accommodate the new domain:
     - Return to v0 and click "Deploy" again
     - Verify that all settings are correct
     - Complete the redeployment process
   - If no code changes were made, Vercel automatically updates your deployment with the new domain

4. **Verify domain configuration**:
   - Visit your new custom domain URL
   - Ensure the site loads correctly
   - Test authentication flows work properly with the new domain
   - Check that all links on your site use the new domain

This custom domain configuration ensures a more professional appearance for your landing page and proper functioning of authentication flows, particularly for email confirmation links that need to redirect users back to your application.

### 1.3.12 Test the Waitlist

Thoroughly test the waitlist signup functionality on your deployed site:

1. **Test various signup scenarios**:
   - Valid email addresses (personal and work domains)
   - Invalid email formats (should show proper validation errors)
   - Empty form submission (should prevent submission)
   - Duplicate signups (should handle gracefully)
   - IMPORTANT: You're using Clerk for authentication; if you implemented a Convex waitlist, ensure the mutation stores emails securely and is rate-limited

2. **Verify email confirmation process**:
   - Sign up with a test email address
   - Check your inbox for the confirmation email
   - Test the confirmation link to ensure it works correctly
   - Verify that the confirmation success page displays properly

3. **Check account records**:
   - In Clerk dashboard, verify test users and email verification status
   - If using Convex waitlist, verify entries via a Convex query or admin page

4. **Test the user experience flow**:
   - Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
   - Verify that success messages appear appropriately
   - Check that the UI provides clear next steps after signup
   - Test the mobile experience of the entire flow

5. **Fix any issues identified**:
   - Address any errors or unexpected behavior
   - Make UI/UX adjustments as needed
   - Redeploy if necessary after making changes
