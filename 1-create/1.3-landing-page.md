### 1.3.1: Add Project Documents

Before starting work on your landing page, add your PRD and marketing story documents to your v0 project for easy reference:

1. **Access the Source section in project settings**:
   - In your v0 project, go to Project Settings
   - Select the "Source" tab

2. **Add your product requirements document**:
   - Click "Create File"
   - Name it `product-requirements.md`
   - Paste the content from your completed PRD (step 1.1)
   - Save the file

3. **Add your marketing story document**:
   - Click "Create File"
   - Name it `marketing-story.md`
   - Paste the content from your marketing story (step 1.2)
   - Save the file

4. **Add your landing page content document**:
   - Click "Create File"
   - Name it `landing-content.md`
   - Paste the content from your landing content (step 1.2)
   - Save the file

5. **Prepare for database schema** (you'll create this in section 1.4):
   - You'll return to the Source section after completing section 1.4
   - At that time, you'll create a file named `database-schema.sql`
   - This will make these documents easily accessible as you build your prototype

Having these documents accessible in your project will make it easier to reference key information while building your landing page.

### 1.3.2 Setup Supabase Starter

To get started with the Supabase starter template:

1. **Clone the Supabase starter**: 
   - Visit [Supabase Starter on v0.dev](https://v0.dev/community/supabase-starter-VLaYTHTngZT) 
   - Clone the project to your v0 workspace by clicking `Open in v0`
   - This starter includes a complete Next.js project with the following structure:
     - Authentication pages (login and signup) — **you'll repurpose these for your waitlist signup**
     - Supabase client configuration
     - Pre-built form components
     - Middleware for authentication
     - Server-side actions

2. **Create a new v0 Project**:
   - After clicking `Open in v0` there will be a new v0 Chat opened named **Supabase Starter** that is not assigned to a v0 project
   - Create a new v0 Project now that will house your Supabase Integration
   - Assign the **Supabase Starter** chat to this newly created project

3. **Set up Supabase using the Vercel Integration (Recommended)**:
   - Within v0, use the Vercel Supabase integration option
   - Open the Project Settings, find the **Integrations** section, and click Add. Add a Supabase integration.
   - This provides one-click setup with no manual configuration required
   - The integration automatically sets up all necessary environment variables including:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
     - All Postgres connection variables (`POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_USER`, etc.)
   - This approach eliminates potential configuration errors and saves time

**Note: Alternative Manual Setup**:
   - If you prefer, you can manually create a Supabase project:
   - Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and sign up or log in
   - Create a new project by clicking "New Project"
   - Enter a name for your project and set a secure database password
   - Select your region (choose one closest to your target audience)
   - Wait for your database to be provisioned (typically 2-3 minutes)
   - Connect your project to Vercel manually by copying the environment variables

**Understanding the Starter Structure**:
   - The project includes prepared authentication flows:
     - `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login page
     - `app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx` - Signup page (you'll use this for collecting waitlist emails)
     - `components/login-form.tsx` and `components/signup-form.tsx` - Form components
   - Supabase configuration is in the `lib/supabase` directory
   - Server actions for authentication are in `lib/actions.ts`
   - **Note**: You'll repurpose the built-in sign-up form to collect interested users' emails for your waitlist rather than creating a new form from scratch

### 1.3.3 Landing Page Creation

Now it's time to design and implement your landing page. You've already created the content in previous steps, so you'll now use v0.dev to transform that content into a functional, attractive landing page that collects email addresses for your waitlist.

**Background:** Your marketing materials (`product-requirements.md`, `marketing-story.md`, and `landing-content.md`) are available in your v0 project under Project Settings → Source. You'll use these as the content basis for your landing page.

1. **Navigate to your Supabase Starter Project**:
   - Return to the **Supabase Starter** chat you created earlier in step 1.3.2
   - Ensure you're in the v0 project you created that has Supabase integrated
   - Open the existing code to familiarize yourself with its structure

2. **Customize the Landing Page with v0.dev**:
   - In the **Supabase Starter** chat, provide this prompt:
   ```
   Design a complete, functional landing page using my existing content in Project Settings → Source. Specifically:

   1. Use the content structure and messaging from `landing-content.md` as the primary source
   2. Incorporate key value propositions and messaging from `marketing-story.md`
   3. Ensure the design aligns with the product vision in `product-requirements.md`
   4. Create a fully responsive design with these key sections:
      - Hero section with compelling headline and clear value proposition
      - Key benefits/features with appropriate visual hierarchy
      - Call-to-action for waitlist signup that integrates with my Supabase backend
      - Success confirmation after signup
   
   I need a complete implementation that:
   - Uses the Supabase Starter's built-in signup form for waitlist signups
   - Follows modern web design best practices
   - Is fully responsive for all device sizes
   - Doesn't use images yet (text-focused for now)
   
   Please modify the existing codebase to create a professional landing page.
   ```

3. **Implement the Suggested Changes**:
   - Review the code modifications suggested by v0.dev
   - Apply the changes to your project files
   - Pay particular attention to:
     - Updates to the homepage in `app/page.tsx`
     - Modifications to the signup form
     - New components created for landing page sections
     - Any CSS/styling updates

4. **Test and Refine Your Landing Page**:
   - Preview your landing page using v0's preview functionality
   - Test the signup form to ensure it properly collects email addresses
   - Test responsiveness by viewing at different screen sizes
   - Make specific adjustments with follow-up prompts, such as:
     ```
     Please make these specific adjustments to improve the landing page:
     1. Make the hero headline more impactful by [your specific request]
     2. Adjust the spacing in the features section to [your specific request]
     3. Modify the call-to-action button to [your specific request]
     ```

The goal is to have a professional-looking landing page that effectively communicates your value proposition while capturing email addresses for your waitlist using Supabase.

### 1.3.4 Quick Style Application

Apply a cohesive visual style to your landing page using [Tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com):

1. **Visit [Tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com)** to browse available styling templates.

2. **Select a template** that aligns with your brand identity:
   - Consider your target audience and the emotional response you want to evoke
   - Look for templates that offer the right balance of professionalism and creativity
   - Choose a template that works well with your content layout
   - Filter templates specifically for TailwindCSS v3, which is fully compatible with your Next.js project

3. **Copy the template code from TweakCN**:
   - Click on your chosen template to view it in detail
   - Find the "Copy Configuration" or "Copy Code" button (usually in the top right corner)
   - This will copy the TailwindCSS configuration to your clipboard
   - The configuration typically includes theme settings for colors, typography, spacing, and other design elements

4. **Apply the template to your v0 project** using this prompt template:
   ```
   Please update my project to use the following TailwindCSS configuration. 
   
   I need you to:
   
   1. Update the tailwind.config.js file with these theme settings
   2. Apply the new styling to my components for consistent design
   3. Ensure the styling works with my existing layout and components
   4. Update any necessary import statements or configurations
   
   Here's the TailwindCSS configuration from TweakCN:
   
   <tailwind>
   [PASTE YOUR COPIED TAILWIND CONFIGURATION HERE]
   </tailwind>
   
   Please make sure all components use these new theme values and update any hardcoded color values or typography settings to use the theme variables instead.
   ```

5. **Test the styling across different devices**:
   - Check your design on desktop, tablet, and mobile views
   - Verify that all interactive elements work correctly with the new styling
   - Make adjustments as needed for optimal display on all devices

6. **Verify consistent application**:
   - Ensure the styling is consistently applied across all components
   - Pay special attention to form elements, buttons, and interactive components
   - Check that your waitlist signup form maintains its functionality with the new styling

### 1.3.5 Deploy

Deploy your landing page to Vercel directly from v0:

1. **Deploy with v0**:
   - In your v0 project, look for the "Deploy" button in the top navigation bar
   - Click "Deploy" to open the deployment options
   - Note: If you used the Vercel Supabase integration, your environment variables are already configured

2. **Complete the deployment**:
   - Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process
   - v0 will handle the deployment to Vercel automatically
   - Wait for the build and deployment to complete
   - Once finished, you'll see a success message with your *.vercel.app URL
   - Click the URL to open your newly deployed site

4. **Verify the deployment**:
   - Test basic navigation on your landing page
   - Ensure all links and buttons work correctly
   - Check that your page displays properly on different screen sizes

### 1.3.6 Configure Custom Domain and Update Supabase

After your initial deployment, customize your domain and update Supabase settings:

1. **Set a custom Vercel subdomain**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard and select your project
   - Navigate to "Settings" → "Domains"
   - In the "Vercel Domains" section, click "Edit"
   - Enter your preferred subdomain name (e.g., your-product-name.vercel.app)
   - Click "Save" to apply the change
   - Vercel will automatically update your deployment to use this custom subdomain

2. **Update Supabase with your custom domain**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Authentication" → "URL Configuration"
   - Update the "Site URL" field with your new custom domain URL
   - Add the following redirect URLs (replacing with your custom domain):
     ```
     https://your-product-name.vercel.app/auth/callback
     https://your-product-name.vercel.app/auth/reset-password
     ```
   - Click "Save" to apply these changes

3. **Redeploy your site if needed**:
   - If you've made any code changes to accommodate the new domain:
     - Return to v0 and click "Deploy" again
     - Verify that all settings are correct
     - Complete the redeployment process
   - If no code changes were made, Vercel automatically updates your deployment with the new domain

4. **Verify domain configuration**:
   - Visit your new custom domain URL
   - Ensure the site loads correctly
   - Test authentication flows work properly with the new domain
   - Check that all links on your site use the new domain

This custom domain configuration ensures a more professional appearance for your landing page and proper functioning of authentication flows, particularly for email confirmation links that need to redirect users back to your application.

### 1.3.7 Test the Waitlist

Thoroughly test the waitlist signup functionality on your deployed site:

1. **Test various signup scenarios**:
   - Valid email addresses (personal and work domains)
   - Invalid email formats (should show proper validation errors)
   - Empty form submission (should prevent submission)
   - Duplicate signups (should handle gracefully)
   - Remember: You're using Supabase's built-in authentication system to collect waitlist emails

2. **Verify email confirmation process**:
   - Sign up with a test email address
   - Check your inbox for the confirmation email
   - Test the confirmation link to ensure it works correctly
   - Verify that the confirmation success page displays properly

3. **Check database records**:
   - Log in to your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to Table Editor → auth.users
   - Verify that test users appear in the database
   - Check that email verification status updates correctly

4. **Test the user experience flow**:
   - Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
   - Verify that success messages appear appropriately
   - Check that the UI provides clear next steps after signup
   - Test the mobile experience of the entire flow

5. **Fix any issues identified**:
   - Address any errors or unexpected behavior
   - Make UI/UX adjustments as needed
   - Redeploy if necessary after making changes
