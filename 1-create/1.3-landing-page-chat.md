### 1.3.1: Add Project Documents

Before starting work on your landing page, add your PRD and marketing story documents to your v0 project for easy reference:

1. **Access the Source section in project settings**:
   - In your v0 project, go to Project Settings
   - Select the "Source" tab

2. **Add your product requirements document**:
   - Click "Create File"
   - Name it `product-requirements.md`
   - Paste the content from your completed PRD (step 1.1)
   - Save the file

3. **Add your marketing story document**:
   - Click "Create File"
   - Name it `marketing-story.md`
   - Paste the content from your marketing story (step 1.2)
   - Save the file

4. **Prepare for database schema** (you'll create this in section 1.4):
   - You'll return to the Source section after completing section 1.4
   - At that time, you'll create a file named `database-schema.sql`
   - This will make these documents easily accessible as you build your prototype

Having these documents accessible in your project will make it easier to reference key information while building your landing page.

### 1.3.2 Setup Supabase Starter

To get started with the Supabase starter template:

1. **Clone the Supabase starter**: 
   - Visit [Supabase Starter on v0.dev](https://v0.dev/community/supabase-starter-VLaYTHTngZT) 
   - Clone the project to your v0 workspace
   - This starter includes a complete Next.js project with the following structure:
     - Authentication pages (login and signup)
     - Supabase client configuration
     - Pre-built form components
     - Middleware for authentication
     - Server-side actions

2. **Set up Supabase using the Vercel Integration (Recommended)**:
   - Within v0, use the Vercel Supabase integration option
   - This provides one-click setup with no manual configuration required
   - The integration automatically sets up all necessary environment variables including:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
     - All Postgres connection variables (`POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_USER`, etc.)
   - This approach eliminates potential configuration errors and saves time

3. **Alternative: Manual Supabase Setup**:
   - If you prefer, you can manually create a Supabase project:
   - Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and sign up or log in
   - Create a new project by clicking "New Project"
   - Enter a name for your project and set a secure database password
   - Select your region (choose one closest to your target audience)
   - Wait for your database to be provisioned (typically 2-3 minutes)
   - Connect your project to Vercel manually by copying the environment variables

4. **For local development**:
   - If needed, create a `.env.local` file in your project root
   - Add at minimum these two variables:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```
   - The Vercel integration will automatically configure a full set of variables in your deployed environment

5. **Explore the starter structure**:
   - The project includes prepared authentication flows:
     - `app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Login page
     - `app/auth/sign-up/page.tsx` - Signup page
     - `components/login-form.tsx` and `components/signup-form.tsx` - Form components
   - Supabase configuration is in the `lib/supabase` directory
   - Server actions for authentication are in `lib/actions.ts`

### 1.3.3 Landing Page Creation

Now it's time to create your landing page. In this step, you'll use v0.dev to design a compelling homepage based on your marketing story and PRD.

1. **Gather your marketing materials**:
   - Open your completed PRD from step 1.1
   - Open your marketing story from step 1.2
   - Identify the key messaging and features to highlight

2. **Create your landing page design in v0.dev**:
   - Start a new design or modify the Supabase starter homepage
   - Include the following elements:
     - Hero section with your main value proposition
     - Key features/benefits section based on your PRD
     - Call-to-action sections for new users
     - Waitlist signup form using Supabase components
     - A confirmation page for successful signups
     - Responsive design elements for all screen sizes

3. **Prompt for v0.dev** (use this as a starting point and customize with your content):
   ```
   Design a compelling homepage that:
   1. Incorporates the core messaging from my marketing story
   2. Does not use any images yet - text only
   3. Includes a hero section with the main value proposition
   4. Highlights key features/benefits as outlined in the PRD
   5. Includes appropriate calls-to-action for new users
   6. Asks users to join the waitlist, uses the stock Supabase sign up form and components (along with verify email functionality)
   7. Displays a positive "you're signed up" page
   8. Is fully responsive and follows modern web design principles

   The homepage should establish the visual identity for the entire application while effectively communicating the product's value to potential users.
   ```

4. **Review and refine your design**:
   - Ensure all key messages from your marketing story are included
   - Check that the design aligns with your brand vision
   - Verify that all UI components are functional and properly connected
   - Ensure the waitlist signup form is properly integrated with Supabase

5. **Make specific adjustments** as needed, using prompts like:
   ```
   Please adjust the design by:
   1. Making the hero headline more concise and impactful
   2. Reorganizing the feature section to highlight [specific feature] more prominently
   3. Improving the contrast on call-to-action buttons
   4. Simplifying the signup form to only collect essential information
   ```

### 1.3.4 Quick Style Application

Apply a cohesive visual style to your landing page using Tweakcn.com:

4. **Customize the template colors and typography**:
   - Replace the template's default colors with your brand colors
   - Adjust typography if needed to match your brand voice
   - Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

5. **Test the styling across different devices**:
   - Check your design on desktop, tablet, and mobile views
   - Verify that all interactive elements work correctly with the new styling
   - Make adjustments as needed for optimal display on all devices

### 1.3.5 Deploy

Deploy your landing page to Vercel to make it publicly accessible:

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   - Create a new GitHub repository
   - Initialize Git in your project folder (if not already done)

     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```

4. **Deploy your project**:
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait for the build and deployment to complete

5. **Update Supabase settings**:
   - Go to your Supabase project → Authentication → URL Configuration
   - Add your Vercel URL to the "Site URL" field
   - Add redirect URLs for authentication flow if necessary

### 1.3.6 Test the Waitlist

Thoroughly test the waitlist signup functionality on your deployed site:

1. **Test various signup scenarios**:
   - Valid email addresses (personal and work domains)
   - Invalid email formats (should show proper validation errors)
   - Empty form submission (should prevent submission)
   - Duplicate signups (should handle gracefully)

2. **Verify email confirmation process**:
   - Sign up with a test email address
   - Check your inbox for the confirmation email
   - Test the confirmation link to ensure it works correctly
   - Verify that the confirmation success page displays properly

3. **Check database records**:
   - Log in to your Supabase dashboard
   - Go to Table Editor → auth.users
   - Verify that test users appear in the database
   - Check that email verification status updates correctly

4. **Test the user experience flow**:
   - Ensure error messages are clear and helpful
   - Verify that success messages appear appropriately
   - Check that the UI provides clear next steps after signup
   - Test the mobile experience of the entire flow

5. **Fix any issues identified**:
   - Address any errors or unexpected behavior
   - Make UI/UX adjustments as needed
   - Redeploy if necessary after making changes
