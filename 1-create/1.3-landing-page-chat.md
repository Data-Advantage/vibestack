### 1.3.1 Setup Supabase Starter

1. How do I clone the Supabase starter from v0.dev?
2. What are the steps to create a Supabase instance for this project?
3. How do I connect my local project to the Supabase instance?
4. What configuration settings should I check before proceeding?

I'm new to this process, so please provide detailed instructions for each step.
```

Once you've received the instructions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Supabase starter [Supabase Starter on v0.dev](https://v0.dev/community/supabase-starter-VLaYTHTngZT)
2. Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and sign up or log in
3. Create a new project and note your API keys
4. Follow the integration steps provided in the response

### 1.3.2 Landing Page Creation

For this step, gather your completed PRD from step 1.1 and marketing story from step 1.2, then create your first landing page design in v0.dev:

```
Please design a compelling homepage that:
1. Incorporates the core messaging from my marketing story
2. Does not use any images yet - text only
3. Includes a hero section with the main value proposition
4. Highlights key features/benefits as outlined in the PRD
5. Includes appropriate calls-to-action for new users
6. Asks users to join the waitlist, uses the stock Supabase sign up form and components (along with verify email functionality)
7. Displays a positive you're signed up page
8. Is fully responsive and follows modern web design principles

The homepage should establish the visual identity for the entire application while effectively communicating the product's value to potential users.

Here's my marketing story content:
[Paste key elements from your marketing story document]

Here are the key features from my PRD:
[Paste 3-5 key features from your PRD]
```

Review the design output from v0.dev and make note of any revisions needed. You can iteratively refine with additional prompts like:

The design looks good, but I'd like to make these specific adjustments:
1. [Describe specific change to hero section]
2. [Describe specific change to feature presentation]
