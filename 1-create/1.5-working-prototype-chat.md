# Day 1: Create

[⬅️ Day 1 Overview](README.md)

## 1.5 Working Prototype

**Goal**: Expand your landing page into a working prototype with core functionality.

**Process**: Continue your work from sections 1.3 (Landing Page) and 1.4 (Database Setup) to build a complete application using [v0.dev](https://www.v0.dev).

**Timeframe**: 2-4 hours

### 1.5.1: Review Existing Progress

Before continuing, ensure you've completed:
1. Section 1.3: Created and deployed your landing page with Supabase integration
2. Section 1.4: Designed and installed your database schema in Supabase

This section will build upon that foundation to create a more functional prototype.

### 1.5.2: Add Database Schema to Project Settings

In your v0 project, go to Project Settings → Source and add:
- `database-schema.sql` - Your database schema from step 1.4

Your `product-requirements.md` and `marketing-story.md` files should already be in place from section 1.3.6.

### 1.5.3: App Implementation Planning

```
I'm building a SaaS application based on the documents `product-requirements.md`, `database-schema.sql`, and `marketing-story.md` that I've added to the project settings -> Sources.

I've already:
1. Created a landing page in section 1.3
2. Set up my database schema in section 1.4

Please create a comprehensive implementation plan that:
1. Identifies the core pages/screens needed based on my PRD
2. Outlines the key components required for each page
3. Suggests an implementation order that prioritizes core functionality
4. Identifies which features to include in this initial build vs. later iterations
5. Provides guidance on connecting the UI to my existing Supabase database

Please structure this as a clear roadmap I can follow while building the application.
```

### 1.5.4: Enhance the Homepage

```
I've already created a basic landing page in section 1.3. Now I'd like to enhance it to support the full application functionality.

Please help me update the existing homepage to:
1. Integrate seamlessly with the application's authentication flow
2. Add any additional UI elements needed for registered users
3. Ensure it connects properly with the other pages we'll be building
4. Maintain its marketing effectiveness while supporting app functionality

The homepage should serve both as a marketing tool and as an entry point to the application for registered users.
```

### 1.5.5: Navigation Structure

```
Now I need a consistent navigation structure for the application.

Please create:
1. A header component with:
   - Logo/brand
   - Main navigation items based on our implementation plan
   - Authentication status (logged in/out)
   - User profile dropdown/menu (for logged-in state)

2. A footer component with:
   - Essential links (About, Privacy, Terms, etc.)
   - Social links if applicable
   - Copyright information

These components should be responsive and maintain consistent styling with the homepage design.
```

### 1.5.6: Database Connection

```
I need to connect my frontend to the Supabase database I created in section 1.4. 

Please help me:
1. Set up the necessary client configuration to connect to my Supabase instance
2. Create reusable hooks or utilities for database operations
3. Implement proper error handling for database operations
4. Structure the code for maintainability and performance

Please provide code examples showing how to:
- Initialize the Supabase client
- Create proper type definitions for my database tables
- Implement basic CRUD operations against my schema
```

### 1.5.7: Core Feature Implementation

```
Let's start implementing the core features according to our plan.

For the next step, please create [specific feature from plan, e.g., "the user dashboard"]. This should:
1. Follow the design aesthetic established in our homepage
2. Implement the functionality described in the PRD
3. Connect to our existing Supabase database for data management
4. Include proper authentication/authorization checks
5. Be fully responsive and accessible

For the Supabase connection, please include code examples showing how to:
- Fetch data from the appropriate tables
- Handle authentication state
- Implement proper error handling
```

### 1.5.8: Authentication Flow

```
I need to implement a complete authentication flow for the application.

Please create the following components:
1. A sign-up page that collects necessary user information
2. A login page for returning users
3. Password reset functionality
4. Email verification process
5. Protected routes that require authentication

These components should integrate with Supabase Auth and follow best practices for security and user experience.
```

### 1.5.9: Iteration and Refinement

```
Now that we have the basic structure and some core features implemented, let's refine the application.

Please review what we've built so far and suggest:
1. UI/UX improvements for better user experience
2. Performance optimizations if needed
3. Any missing functionality from our initial plan
4. Next features to implement in priority order

Also, please provide guidance on testing the application to ensure everything works correctly before deployment.
```

### 1.5.10: Deployment Preparation

```
As we prepare to deploy this initial version, please help me with:

1. A pre-launch checklist to ensure everything is working correctly
2. Instructions for configuring environment variables in production
3. Suggestions for monitoring application performance and errors
4. Any final optimizations for SEO, performance, or accessibility

This will ensure our Day 1 build is ready to share with potential users and gather feedback.
