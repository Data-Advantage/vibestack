# Day 1: Create

[⬅️ Day 1 Overview](README.md)

## 1.5 Working Prototype

**Goal**: Create a working basic version of your application using the requirements developed in the morning.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern within an AI vibe coding tool such as [v0.dev](https://www.v0.dev).

**Timeframe**: 2-4 hours

### 1.5.1: Fork the Supabase Starter Project

1. Sign in to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
2. Go to [Supabase Starter on v0.dev](https://v0.dev/community/supabase-starter-VLaYTHTngZT)
3. Click the `Open in V0` button to create your own copy of the project

### 1.5.2: Add Supabase Integration 

1. In your v0 project, navigate to the integration settings
2. Connect your Vercel account if prompted
3. Add Supabase integration by following the on-screen instructions
4. Ensure your Supabase project URL and API keys are properly configured

### 1.5.3: Add Your Documents to Project Settings

1. In your v0 project, go to Project Settings → Source
2. Create the following markdown files and paste your content:
   - `product-requirements.md` - Your PRD from step 1.1
   - `database-schema.sql` - Your database schema from step 1.2
   - `marketing-story.md` - Your marketing content from step 1.3

### 1.5.4: Install Database Schema

1. Navigate to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Create a new query and paste your entire database schema script
4. Run the script to set up your database

If you encounter errors:
- Copy the error messages
- Ask Claude to fix the errors
- Get an updated script and try again

### 1.5.5: Begin v0.dev Chat

Now you're ready to start building your initial app. Begin with these suggested prompts in the following sections.

### 1.5.6: App Implementation Planning

```
I'm building a SaaS application based on the documents `product-requirements.md`, `database-schema.sql`, and `marketing-story.md` that I've added to the project settings -> Sources.

Please create a comprehensive implementation plan that:
1. Identifies the core pages/screens needed based on my PRD
2. Outlines the key components required for each page
3. Suggests an implementation order that prioritizes core functionality
4. Identifies which features to include in this initial build vs. later iterations
5. Provides guidance on connecting the UI to Supabase for data management

Please structure this as a clear roadmap I can follow while building the application.
```

### 1.5.7: Homepage Implementation

```
Based on our implementation plan, let's start by creating the homepage for the application.

Please design a compelling homepage that:
1. Incorporates the core messaging from my marketing story
2. Includes a hero section with the main value proposition
3. Highlights key features/benefits as outlined in the PRD
4. Includes appropriate calls-to-action for new users
5. Is fully responsive and follows modern web design principles

The homepage should establish the visual identity for the entire application while effectively communicating the product's value to potential users.
```

### 1.5.8: Navigation Structure

```
Now I need a consistent navigation structure for the application.

Please create:
1. A header component with:
   - Logo/brand
   - Main navigation items based on our implementation plan
   - Authentication status (logged in/out)
   - User profile dropdown/menu (for logged-in state)

2. A footer component with:
   - Essential links (About, Privacy, Terms, etc.)
   - Social links if applicable
   - Copyright information

These components should be responsive and maintain consistent styling with the homepage design.
```

### 1.5.9: Core Feature Implementation

```
Let's start implementing the core features according to our plan.

For the next step, please create [specific feature from plan, e.g., "the user dashboard"]. This should:
1. Follow the design aesthetic established in our homepage
2. Implement the functionality described in the PRD
3. Connect to Supabase for data management
4. Include proper authentication/authorization checks
5. Be fully responsive and accessible

For the Supabase connection, please include code examples showing how to:
- Fetch data from the appropriate tables
- Handle authentication state
- Implement proper error handling
```

### 1.5.10: Iteration and Refinement

```
Now that we have the basic structure and some core features implemented, let's refine the application.

Please review what we've built so far and suggest:
1. UI/UX improvements for better user experience
2. Performance optimizations if needed
3. Any missing functionality from our initial plan
4. Next features to implement in priority order

Also, please provide guidance on testing the application to ensure everything works correctly before deployment.
```

### 1.5.11: Deployment Preparation

```
As we prepare to deploy this initial version, please help me with:

1. A pre-launch checklist to ensure everything is working correctly
2. Instructions for configuring environment variables in production
3. Suggestions for monitoring application performance and errors
4. Any final optimizations for SEO, performance, or accessibility

This will ensure our Day 1 build is ready to share with potential users and gather feedback.
