### 1.1.1: Idea Exploration & Validation

```
I have a SaaS idea: [briefly describe your idea in 1-3 sentences]

Help me explore this concept by:

1. Summarizing my core idea and identifying its unique value proposition
2. Identifying 3-5 key problems it solves and for which specific user personas
3. Outlining potential market opportunities and competitive landscape
4. Suggesting 3 potential revenue models for this idea
5. Highlighting any obvious technical or business challenges

Finally, provide 5 thought-provoking questions I should consider that will help me refine this idea further.
```

### 1.1.2 (_optional_): Idea Analysis & Refinement

```
I have read the exploratory ideas and here are my thoughts:
1. [take the time to read the responses, then type in your newest ideas and feedback]
2. [where was it missing the mark]
3. [thoughts on Free account limitations]
4. [thoughts on Pro user monthly/yearly pricing e.g. $7/mo & $70/year]

Please incorporate these ideas and restate the core SaaS idea again.
```

### 1.1.3: Competitive Analysis & Market Positioning

```
Now that we've explored the basic idea, I need a detailed competitive analysis and positioning strategy:

1. Identify the top 5 direct competitors in this space (both startups and established players)
2. For each competitor, analyze:
   - Core feature set and pricing model
   - Primary user base and acquisition strategy
   - Key strengths and weaknesses
   - User reviews and sentiment

3. Create a precise differentiation statement that explains:
   - Our exact unique value proposition relative to each competitor
   - Why users would switch from existing solutions to ours
   - The specific user pain points we solve that competitors don't
   - How we'll maintain this advantage over time

4. Develop a "complete the sentence" positioning statement:
   "For [specific user persona] who [specific pain point], [our product] provides [key benefit] unlike [main competitor] which [competitor limitation]."

5. Identify any competitor features we should explicitly NOT build to maintain our differentiation.

Finally, create a simple competitive positioning matrix showing our product versus top competitors on 2-3 key dimensions that matter most to users.
```

### 1.1.4: Product Vision & User Journey

```
Based on our previous discussion about [idea name], I'd like to develop a clearer product vision and user journey.

Please help me create:

1. A concise product vision statement (1-2 sentences)
2. Top 3 strategic goals for this product in year one
3. Detailed user journey map showing:
   - Complete end-to-end user flows for primary scenarios
   - Screen-by-screen navigation paths
   - State transitions and decision points
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - User touchpoints and interaction patterns
4. 5-7 key features that would constitute an MVP, organized by priority
5. Success metrics that would indicate product-market fit
6. Recommendation a sequence of milestones for MVP development (do not attach a timeframe or time estimate, just a sequence is fine)

For each feature, please include a brief explanation of why it's essential and how it serves the target users.
```

### 1.1.5 (_optional_): Strategy Analysis & Refinement

```
I have read the strategy and here are my thoughts:

1. [take the time to read the vision & strategy, then type in your evaluations and feedback]
2. [where was it missing the mark]

Please incorporate these ideas and restate the core product vision again.
```

### 1.1.6: User Acquisition Strategy

```
Before finalizing our PRD, I need a detailed user acquisition strategy. Please help me develop:

1. First 100 Users Strategy:
   - 3-5 specific tactics to acquire our very first users with minimal/zero budget
   - How we'll collect and incorporate their feedback
   - Success metrics for this phase

2. Growth to 1,000 Users Strategy:
   - Channel-specific approaches (organic social, content, communities, etc.)
   - Methods to leverage existing users for referrals and growth
   - Timeline and resources required

3. Scaling Beyond 1,000 Users:
   - Potential paid acquisition channels with estimated CAC
   - Content and SEO strategy with specific keyword targets
   - Partnership opportunities for user acquisition

4. Activation Optimization:
   - Clear definition of an "activated" user
   - Step-by-step user journey from acquisition to activation
   - Potential drop-off points and how to address them

5. Key Metrics and Economics:
   - Target CAC for each channel
   - Expected conversion rates from free to paid
   - Estimated LTV based on our pricing model
   - Break-even timeline given these assumptions

Please ensure this acquisition strategy aligns with our core value proposition and target user personas.
```

**Save this output separately as `user-acquisition.md`**. This valuable document will be referenced throughout your project, particularly during Day 2 to find users for feedback and Day 5 for inviting new users in the target audience.

### 1.1.7: Detailed Business & Feature Requirements

```
Based on our previous discussions, please create a detailed breakdown of the custom features that make our product unique:

- Ordered List of Custom Feature Requirements:
   - Detailed breakdown of each MVP feature that differentiates our product
   - User stories for each feature (using the "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]" format)
   - Acceptance criteria for each feature
   - Dependencies between features

For each user story, please include:
- Story format: "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- Priority tag: [MVP-Core, MVP-Secondary, V2, Future]

```

### 1.1.10: MVP Scope Reduction & Risk Assessment

```
I need a clearer MVP definition with explicit categorization:

1. MVP-Core Features (Must Have):
   - Limited to 3-5 features that represent the absolute minimum to test our value proposition
   - Each feature must directly address our primary user persona's most critical pain point
   - For each feature, provide explicit success criteria that would validate product-market fit

2. MVP-Secondary Features:
   - 3-5 features that enhance the core experience but could be simplified initially
   - How each could be implemented in a simpler form for MVP
   - Clear criteria for when these become necessary

3. Post-MVP Roadmap (V2):
   - Features planned for immediate post-MVP development
   - Dependencies on MVP features
   - How they extend rather than replace MVP functionality

4. Future Considerations:
   - Explicitly identify features mentioned in requirements that should NOT be in MVP
   - Categorize by quarter/phase when they might be reconsidered
   
For each feature categorization, provide clear rationale tied to user value and technical complexity.

5. Technical Risk Assessment:
   - Identify the 3 highest technical risk components in our plan
   - For each risk, suggest a minimum test to validate feasibility
   - Outline fallback options if primary approaches don't work

6. User Experience Compromises:
   - Suggest acceptable UX compromises for MVP that won't alienate users
   - Identify "wizard of oz" opportunities to fake complex functionality initially
   - List manual processes that could replace automated ones for MVP
```

### 1.1.11: Scope & Feasibility Advisor

```
Based on our comprehensive PRD and MVP scope reduction plan, I need your help evaluating scope and creating a strategic implementation plan and final full PRD that combines all user stories. Remember to fully leverage built-in features of NextJS, v0, Supabase, and Stripe Customer Portal. Please provide:

1. Sequenced Implementation Plan:
   - Organize MVP features into 5-7 sequential "sprints"
   - Define explicit dependencies between features
   - Provide implementation order with rationale
   - Flag any features that can be developed in parallel

2. Technical Risk Assessment:
   - Identify high-risk components that should be prototyped first
   - Suggest simplified implementations for complex features
   - Provide fallback options for technically challenging elements

3. Clear Definition of Done:
   - Specific acceptance criteria for the entire MVP
   - Measurable indicators that signal MVP completion
   - Clear distinction between "working prototype" vs "complete MVP"

4. Feature Categorization:
   - Features that form the core MVP to be developed in a working prototype (Day 1)
   - More complex or secondary features to be developed in a full app build (Day 3)
   - Features explicitly deferred to future releases beyond the initial sprint
   - For each parked item, provide a brief justification for deferment
   - Indicate which release cycle (post-MVP, v2, long-term) each item might fit into
   - Note any technical dependencies that should be considered during initial development

For each category, please:
- Provide clear justification for your categorization decisions
- Identify any dependencies between features across categories
- Note any technical considerations for implementation planning
- Estimate relative effort required for key features

Please organize this into three things:
1. Clear advisory statement
2. Strategic implementation plan that helps balance ambition with pragmatism, ensuring we deliver a compelling product in stages.
3. A numbered overview of every user story section and title in the final PRD
```

### 1.1.12: Database Implementation Prioritization

```
Based on our MVP categorization, I need a database implementation prioritization:

1. Core Database Entities:
   - Identify the essential tables required ONLY for MVP-Core features
   - Specify which columns are mandatory for MVP vs. nice-to-have
   - Note any schema flexibility needed for future extension
   
2. Data Relationships Prioritization:
   - Which relationships between entities are critical for MVP
   - Which can be simplified or managed in application code initially
   - Any denormalization that may help MVP implementation

3. Security and Access Pattern Focus:
   - The specific RLS policies needed for MVP security
   - Which user roles must be supported in MVP
   - Any security considerations that can be deferred

Please organize these into a clear database implementation guide that explicitly separates MVP requirements from future considerations, with justification for each decision.
```
