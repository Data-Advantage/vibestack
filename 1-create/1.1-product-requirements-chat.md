### 1.1.1: Idea Exploration & Validation

```
I have a SaaS idea: [briefly describe your idea in 1-3 sentences]

Help me explore this concept by:

1. Summarizing my core idea and identifying its unique value proposition
2. Identifying 3-5 key problems it solves and for which specific user personas
3. Outlining potential market opportunities and competitive landscape
4. Suggesting 3 potential revenue models for this idea
5. Highlighting any obvious technical or business challenges

Finally, provide 5 thought-provoking questions I should consider that will help me refine this idea further.
```

### 1.1.2 (_optional_): Idea Analysis & Refinement

```
I have read the exploratory ideas and here are my thoughts:
1. [take the time to read the responses, then type in your newest ideas and feedback]
2. [where was it missing the mark]
3. [thoughts on Free account limitations]
4. [thoughts on Pro user monthly/yearly pricing e.g. $7/mo & $70/year]

Please incorporate these ideas and restate the core SaaS idea again.
```

### 1.1.3: Product Vision & Strategy

```
Based on our previous discussion about [idea name], I'd like to develop a clearer product vision.

Please help me create:

1. A concise product vision statement (1-2 sentences)
2. Top 3 strategic goals for this product in year one
3. Core user journey map showing the primary workflow through the product
4. 5-7 key features that would constitute an MVP, organized by priority
5. Success metrics that would indicate product-market fit
6. Recommendation a sequence of milestones for MVP development (do not attach a timeframe or time estimate, just a sequence is fine)

For each feature, please include a brief explanation of why it's essential and how it serves the target users.
```

### 1.1.4 (_optional_): Strategy Analysis & Refinement

```
I have read the strategy and here are my thoughts:

1. [take the time to read the vision & strategy, then type in your evaluations and feedback]
2. [where was it missing the mark]

Please incorporate these ideas and restate the core product vision again.
```

### 1.1.5: Detailed Business & Feature Requirements

```
Based on our previous discussions, please create a detailed breakdown of the custom features that make our product unique:

- Ordered List of Custom Feature Requirements:
   - Detailed breakdown of each MVP feature that differentiates our product
   - User stories for each feature (using the "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]" format)
   - Acceptance criteria for each feature
   - Dependencies between features

For each user story, please include:
- Story format: "As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria that clearly define when the story is complete
- Key technical considerations for implementation
- Any dependencies between stories

Please format this as a structured PRD document focused solely on our unique value proposition and core functionality that I could share with developers, designers, and potential investors.

For now please do not focus on standard SaaS requirements like Authentication/Login, Payments/Subscriptions, Database/Storage, Backend Processing, Status/Logging/Errors, Developer APIs, Administration/Monitoring, and Non-Functional Requirements. Those will come later. Only work on the differentiated functional requirements for now.
```

### 1.1.6: Backend Processing & AI Worker Requirements

```
Based on our product vision, I need a comprehensive overview of the backend processing requirements, particularly for AI workers and status updates. Please help me develop detailed specifications for:

1. AI Worker Infrastructure:
   - Worker pool management and scaling
   - Task queue implementation
   - Worker health monitoring
   - Resource allocation and optimization
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. Status Updates & Progress Tracking:
   - Real-time status update system
   - Progress tracking mechanisms
   - Status history storage
   - Notification system for status changes
   - Webhook integration for external systems

3. Data Processing Pipeline:
   - Input validation and preprocessing
   - Processing stages and workflow
   - Intermediate result storage
   - Final output generation
   - Cleanup and resource management

4. Database Integration:
   - Status update storage schema
   - Historical data management
   - Query optimization for status tracking
   - Data retention policies
   - Backup and recovery procedures

5. AI Models & Provider Integration:
   - Model selection strategy (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
   - Provider fallback mechanisms
   - Implementation using Vercel's AI SDK
   - UI component integration with AI SDK UI
   - Cost optimization and usage tracking
   - Model performance monitoring
   - Prompt management and versioning
   - Token usage optimization

6. Developer API:
   - RESTful API design and documentation
   - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Rate limiting and usage quotas
   - Versioning strategy
   - Webhook integration for event notifications
   - Example implementations and code samples

For each component, please include:
- User stories in "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]" format
- Acceptance criteria that clearly define when the story is complete
- Technical considerations for implementation (do not recommend technologies)
- Dependencies (if any)
- Performance requirements and SLAs

Please organize these into a structured product requirements document that would help guide development of our backend processing infrastructure. For now ignore all standard SaaS Business requirement categories such as Non-Functional Requirements, Authentication & User Management, Subscription Management, Payment Processing, and Administration & Monitoring - those will come later. Output as a standalone section of a final Product Requirements Document as a markdown file. It should be additive to the previous user stories.
```

### 1.1.7: SaaS Business Requirements

```

1. Non-Functional Requirements:

   - Security considerations
   - Scalability needs
   - Compliance requirements

2. Authentication & User Management:
   - User signup (email and social login options)

   - Integration status monitoring
   - Usage statistics and administrative dashboards
   - Data backup monitoring and restoration
   - Queue management and performance metrics
   - System health monitoring and alerts
   - Audit logs for security and compliance

For each component, please include:
- User stories in "As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]" format
- Acceptance criteria that clearly define when the story is complete
- Technical considerations for implementation
- Dependencies (if any)

Please organize these into a structured product requirements document that would help guide development of a set of standard SaaS requirements. Output as a standalone section of a final Product Requirements Document as a markdown file. It should be additive to the previous user stories.
```

### 1.1.8: Scope & Feasibility Advisor

```
Based on our comprehensive PRD, I need your help evaluating scope and creating a strategic implementation plan and final full PRD that combines all user stories. Please categorize our features into:

1. Basic Features:
   - Features that form the core MVP to be developed on Day 1
   - These should represent the minimum functionality needed for a viable product
   - Should be implementable within a limited timeframe while delivering meaningful value

2. Advanced Features:
   - More complex or secondary features to be developed on Day 3
   - Features that enhance the product but aren't essential for first launch
   - May require more technical complexity or build upon basic features

3. Parking Lot:
   - Features explicitly deferred to future releases beyond the initial sprint
   - For each parked item, provide a brief justification for deferment
   - Indicate which release cycle (post-MVP, v2, long-term) each item might fit into
   - Note any technical dependencies that should be considered during initial development

For each category, please:
- Provide clear justification for your categorization decisions
- Identify any dependencies between features across categories
- Note any technical considerations for implementation planning
- Estimate relative effort required for key features

Please organize this into three things:
1. Clear advisory statement
2. Strategic implementation plan that helps balance ambition with pragmatism, ensuring we deliver a compelling product in stages.
3. A numbered overview of every user story section and title in the final PRD
```

### 1.1.9 Final Product Requirements Document

```
Finally, output a final full PRD file in markdown with a appropriate preambles, numbering, and all detailed info from previous sections. Please format this as a structured PRD document that I could share with developers, designers, and potential investors.
