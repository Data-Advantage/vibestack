# 1.1.8: Scope & Feasibility Advisor

```
Based on our comprehensive PRD, I need your help evaluating scope and creating a strategic "Parking Lot" for future development. Please review our requirements and:

1. Scope Assessment:
   - Identify any potential scope creep in our current MVP requirements
   - Flag features that could be deferred to post-MVP releases
   - Suggest any missing critical MVP components that should be prioritized

2. "Parking Lot" Creation:
   - Recommend if any features should be explicitly deferred to future releases
   - For each parked item, provide a brief justification for deferment
   - Indicate which release cycle (post-MVP, v2, long-term) each item might fit into
   - Note any technical dependencies that should be considered during initial development

Please organize this into a clear advisory document that helps balance ambition with pragmatism, ensuring our MVP is both achievable and strategically positioned for future growth.
