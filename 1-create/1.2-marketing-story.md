# Day 1: Create

[⬅️ Day 1 Overview](README.md)

## 1.2 Marketing Story

**Goal**: Create compelling marketing narrative named `marketing-story.md` that will help users understand and connect with your product. Also create basic content for your landing page in `landing-page.md`.

**Process**: Follow this chat pattern with an AI chat tool such as [Claude.ai](https://www.claude.ai). Pay attention to the notes in `[brackets]` and replace the brackets with your own thoughts and ideas.

**Timeframe**: 30-45 minutes

### 1.2.1: Customer Story & Value Proposition Development

```
I'd like to develop a comprehensive marketing story for my SaaS product. Please paste your completed product requirements document (PRD) from step 1.1 below:

<product-requirements-document>
[Paste your PRD here]
</product-requirements-document>

Thank you for sharing your product requirements. Based on this information, I'll now develop a strategic marketing foundation for your SaaS product.

Let's analyze the following key marketing elements:

## 1. Target Audience Analysis

I'll identify your core customer segments and create detailed profiles including:
- Firmographics (for B2B): company size, industry, revenue
- Demographics: age, gender, location, income level, education
- Psychographics: values, attitudes, interests, lifestyle
- Technographics: technical aptitude, preferred platforms

## 2. Job to be Done Framework

I'll identify:
- Functional jobs your customers are trying to accomplish
- Emotional jobs they want to feel
- Social jobs they want to be perceived doing

## 3. Value Proposition Canvas

Following Strategyzer's Value Proposition Canvas model, I'll develop:
- Customer profile (jobs, pains, gains)
- Value map (products/services, pain relievers, gain creators)
- How your solution addresses specific customer needs

## 4. Positioning Statement

From Geoffrey Moore in *Crossing the Chasm*, create a clear, compelling statement that communicates:
> For (target customer) who (statement of the need or opportunity), the (product name) is a (product category) that (statement of key benefit – that is, compelling reason to buy). Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (statement of primary differentiation).

## 5. Unique Selling Proposition

Based on Apple's marketing, I'll create a unique selling proposition that:
- Clearly articulates what makes your product different
- Is simple, memorable, and focused on customer benefits
- Addresses the "why" behind your product's existence
- Creates an emotional connection with your audience
- Is consistently reinforced across all marketing channels

## 6. StoryBrand Framework

Using Donald Miller's framework, I'll craft a narrative where:

- The customer is the hero
- Your brand is the guide
- You provide a clear plan to help them overcome challenges
- Clear call to action that avoids confusion

Based on your requirements, here's my analysis of these marketing components:
```
